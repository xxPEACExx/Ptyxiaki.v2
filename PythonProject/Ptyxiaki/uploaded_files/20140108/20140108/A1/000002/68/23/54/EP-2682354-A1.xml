By pressing the flexible inner bag, the content housed in the inner bag is discharged to the outside through an inflow port.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In this type of aerosol container, the content does not come into contact with the pressurized fluid, and therefore any desired pressurized fluid can be used. Further, the pressurized fluid is not discharged together with the content, and therefore the content can be discharged efficiently.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">When, in this type of aerosol container, a remaining amount of the content discharged from the flexible inner bag decreases, the inner bag becomes wrinkled or bent such that enclosed spaces are formed, and the content inevitably remains in these spaces to the last.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">To reduce this final remaining amount, a dip tube is conventionally attached as a remainder reducing member so that the content can be discharged to the outside from both the vicinity of the inflow port and a tip end of the dip tube.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 8</figref> shows a conventional aerosol container provided with a dip tube.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In this example, an inner bag 502 housing content F is provided in the interior of an outer can 501 of an aerosol container 500, and the inner bag 502 is provided with a spout 504 having a stem 505 in an upper portion thereof and an inflow port 503 opened in an interior thereof.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">A pressurized fluid G such as nitrogen gas is charged into a space between the outer can 501 and the inner bag 502 such that when the stem 505 is pressed, the content housed in the inner bag 502 flows into the inflow port 503 so as to be discharged to the outside from a tip end of the stem 505.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Further, a dip tube 511 serving as a remainder reducing member is inserted into the inflow port 503, and at this time, an inner periphery of the inflow port 503 is formed such that a flow passage for the content F is secured between the inflow port 503 and the dip tube 511. Hence, as shown by arrows, the content F is guided in the direction of the stem 505 from both the vicinity of the inflow port 503 and the vicinity of a tip end of the dip tube 511, and then discharged to the outside.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In another conventional aerosol container shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 9B</figref>, a plurality of flexible inner bags are disposed in a single outer can such that different types of content can be housed without intermixing and discharged simultaneously.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">With this type of aerosol container, intermixing of the content prior to discharge can be prevented completely without the need to connect a plurality of outer cans or provide special internal structures. Further, the pressurized fluid need only be charged once into the single outer can, and therefore manufacture is easy (see Patent Document 2 and so on, for example).</p><p id="p0012" num="0012"><ul><li>Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent Application Publication<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2004075099A"><text>2004-75099</text></patcit> (all pages, all drawings)</li><li>Patent Document 2: Japanese Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2005231644A"><text>2005-231644</text></patcit> (all pages, all drawings)</li><li>Patent Document 3: Japanese Patent Application Publication No.<patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JPH11105893B"><text> H11-105893</text></patcit> (all pages, all drawings)</li></ul></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The content that inevitably remains in conventional aerosol containers such as those described in Patent Documents 1 and 2 can be reduced to a certain extent by providing the dip tube serving as the conventional remainder reducing member described above, and in so doing, the final remaining amount can be reduced. However, when an enclosed space forms in an intermediate position removed from both the vicinity of the inflow port and the tip end of the dip tube, the content still inevitably remains in the formed space. Moreover, content also remains in the interior of the dip tube.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Meanwhile, another conventional remainder reducing member for extracting content from a flexible container, albeit not an inner bag of an aerosol container, such that no content remains is constituted by a rigid rod-shaped body having a plurality of hollowed-out portions, which is disposed to extend from an inflow port into the interior of the container (see Patent Document 3 and so on, for example).</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">However, a conventional remainder reducing member such as that described in Patent Document 3 is constructed on the assumption that the flexible container is pressed from the outside by a human hand to guide the content toward the inflow port.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Hence, in an inner bag of an aerosol container, the entirety of which is pressed evenly by a pressurized fluid, content remaining in enclosed spaces cannot be guided to the inflow port by these remainder reducing members, and in fact, the enclosed spaces may be increased by projecting portions and hollowed-out portions provided on these conventional remainder reducing members, leading to an increase in the remaining amount.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Moreover, increasing a pressure of the pressurized fluid simply leads to an increase in a closing force exerted on the enclosed space, and does not therefore contribute to a reduction in the remaining amount of content.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0018" num="0018">It is therefore an object of the present invention to solve these problems in the conventional remainder reducing members described above by providing a remainder reducing member which is capable of preventing the formation of enclosed spaces due to a pressurized fluid so that a final remaining amount of content to be discharged can be reduced, which has a simple structure and is therefore easy to manufacture, which can be attached to an interior of an inner bag easily, and with which the content can be discharged smoothly to the last.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">An invention according to claim 1 solves the problems described above by providing a remainder reducing member that is attached to an interior of a flexible inner bag disposed in an interior of an aerosol container in order to reduce a final remaining amount of content to be discharged, and that is constituted by a solid rod-shaped body , this remainder reducing member including: an attachment portion attached to an inflow port of the inner bag such that the content can flow therein; and a guiding portion provided with a plurality of guiding grooves formed in a lengthwise direction of an outer periphery thereof.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">An invention according to claim 2 solves the problems described above by, in addition to the configuration of the remainder reducing member described in claim 1, providing the attachment portion on both ends of the guiding portion.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">An invention according to claim 3 solves the problems described above by, in addition to the configuration of the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> remainder reducing member described in claim 1 or claim 2, forming the guiding portion in a columnar shape, and providing the guiding grooves in the outer periphery at 90° circumferential direction intervals.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">An invention according to claim 4 solves the problems described above by, in addition to the configuration of the remainder reducing member described in claim 3, forming the guiding grooves with a V-shaped cross-section having a 90° contained angle, and forming the guiding portion with a cross-shaped cross-section.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">An invention according to claim 5 solves the problems described above by, in addition to the configuration of the remainder reducing member described in any of claims 1 to 4, forming an end surface of the attachment portion in a smooth convex surface shape.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">An invention according to claim 6 solves the problems described above by, in addition to the configuration of the remainder reducing member described in any of claims 1 to 5, forming end portion grooves between the attachment portion and the guiding portion in a perpendicular direction to the lengthwise direction.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">An invention according to claim 7 solves the problems described above by, in addition to the configuration of the remainder reducing member described in any of claims 1 to 6, forming at least one discharge groove in a lengthwise direction in an outer periphery of the attachment portion.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">An invention according to claim 8 solves the problems described above by, in addition to the configuration of the remainder reducing member described in claim 7, forming the attachment portion in a columnar shape, and providing the discharge grooves in the outer periphery at 180° circumferential direction intervals.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">An invention according to claim 9 solves the problems described above by, in addition to the configuration of the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> remainder reducing member described in any of claims 1 to 8, providing an overlap prevention portion in an intermediate position of the guiding portion in the lengthwise direction, this overlap prevention portion being formed to have a sectional shape different from a shape of a part formed with the guiding grooves.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">An invention according to claim 10 solves the problems described above by, in addition to the configuration of the remainder reducing member described in claim 9, forming intermediate grooves respectively between the overlap prevention portion and the guiding portion on either side thereof in a perpendicular direction to the lengthwise direction, and forming at least one connecting groove that connects the intermediate grooves on the respective sides and has a predetermined angle relative to the lengthwise direction in an outer periphery of the overlap prevention portion.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">An invention according to claim 11 solves the problems described above by, in addition to the configuration of the remainder reducing member described in claim 10, forming the overlap prevention portion in a columnar shape, and providing the connecting grooves in the outer periphery in parallel at 180° circumferential direction intervals.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">An invention according to claim 12 solves the problems described above by, in addition to the configuration of the remainder reducing member described in claim 9, forming the overlap prevention portion such that a wall portion thereof adjacent to the guiding grooves bulges out toward the guiding grooves.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">An invention according to claim 13 solves the problems described above by, in addition to the configuration of the remainder reducing member described in claim 12, forming the overlap prevention portion in a cylindrical shape, and providing a gate for use during injection molding in an interior of the cylindrical overlap prevention portion.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">With the remainder reducing member according to the invention<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> described in claim 1, when the remaining amount of the content decreases, the guiding portion having the plurality of guiding grooves formed in the lengthwise direction of the outer periphery functions as a passage for causing the content to flow toward the inflow port, and therefore formation of enclosed spaces due to a pressurized fluid can be prevented over an entire length of the remainder reducing member. As a result, a final remaining amount of the content to be discharged can be reduced.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Further, at a final stage of discharge of the content, the inner bag itself is deformed by pressure so as to enter the guiding grooves, and therefore the amount of content remaining in the guiding grooves is also extremely small. Hence, the amount of content remaining in the interior of the remainder reducing member itself can also be greatly reduced.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Moreover, the remainder reducing member has an extremely simple structure, and is therefore easy and inexpensive to manufacture and extremely easy to attach to the inflow port of the inner bag.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">According to the configuration described in claim 2, either end portion of the remainder reducing member can be attached to the inflow port, thereby eliminating the need to align a lengthwise direction orientation thereof during manufacture, and as a result, the remainder reducing member can be attached easily.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">According to the configuration described in claim 3, even when the remaining amount of the content decreases in a case where the inner bag is structured as a pouch formed by fusing together two sheets, for example, the guiding grooves function as a passage at all times, regardless of an axial attachment angle of the remainder reducing member, and therefore the attachment angle does not have to be determined during manufacture. As a result, the remainder reducing member can be attached easily.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">According to the configuration described in claim 4, a capacity of the guiding grooves can be increased, and therefore<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> the content can be discharged smoothly.
