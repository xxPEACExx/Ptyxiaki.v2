The circulation device, for example consisting in a screw member taken in rotation according to an axis longitudinal to the tank, is suitable to convey the cooled product towards a front zone, where a dispenser device for the product is placed. The dispenser device is provided with an obturator element which can be actuated by means of an external lever member. </p><p id="p0008" num="0008"> A drawback complained by the users in the use of the cited apparatuses consists in the thermal dispersion occurring between the inside of the tank, maintained at a low temperature by the cited device for cooling the product,

 and the external environment. Practically, part of the refrigerating power of the apparatus is dispersed in the environment so, in order to maintain the product at the required temperature, the cooling device must be constantly maintained in function to make up for the cited thermal dispersion. This obviously causes an elevated energetic consumption and as a consequence a bigger cost of the product. </p><p id="p0009" num="0009"> [05] The difference of temperature between the inside of the tank and the external environment further causes the formation of condensate and in some cases of a layer of ice on the wall of the tank, often made of transparent material. Further to producing an unpleasant esthetical aspect, this renders the vision of the product inside the tank difficult. </p><p id="p0010" num="0010"> [06] Then it has to be observed that, always on account of the cited heat dispersion, the known apparatuses are not able to function correctly when the external temperature is very high, as the cooling device does not have the power necessary to reduce the temperature inside the tank to the value required for preparing refrigerated products. </p><p id="p0011" num="0011"> Disclosure </p><p id="p0012" num="0012"> [07] The task of the present invention is that of solving the aforementioned problems, devising an apparatus for preparing and dispensing refrigerated products which allows to efficiently limit the thermal dispersions. </p><p id="p0013" num="0013"> [08] Within such task, it is a further scope of the present invention that of providing an apparatus which enables the preparation of refrigerated products also with high external temperatures. </p><p id="p0014" num="0014"> [09] Another object of the invention is that of providing an apparatus for

Inside the containment tank 2 is arranged, in a known manner, a mixing device 3 consisting in a screw member driven in rotation according to an axis longitudinal to the tank 2 in order to cause the continuous circulation of the product inside the same tank 2. Inside the tank 2 is further arranged a 
<!-- EPO <DP n="7"/>-->
 cooling device 4 for cooling the product to the suitable temperature. A temperature sensor, preferably arranged inside the tank 2 in proximity of the front wall, is suitable to control the temperature of the product at the dispensing zone. </p><p id="p0033" num="0033"> [27] The containment tank 2 has frontally a dispenser device 5 provided with an obturator member 6 which can be actuated by means of an external lever member 7. The obturator member 6 is sliding inside a cylindrical seat realized, with a substantially vertical axis, by a sleeve 28 shaped by the tank 2. </p><p id="p0034" num="0034"> [28] The containment tank 2 is mounted above a base body 9 having a substantially prismatic shape. The base body 9 is suitable to contain in its own inside the actuation members of the apparatus, known per se and not described in more detail. </p><p id="p0035" num="0035"> [29] According to the present invention, the containment tank 2 is insulated by means of thermally insulating walls in a way as to reduce the thermal exchange between the external environment and the inside of the same tank 2. Such thermally insulating walls comprise a first internal wall 21 and a second external wall 22 between which a hermetically closed interspace 23 is defined. Preferably in said interspace 23 is contained a low thermal conductivity gas, which for simplicity can be constituted by air. The gas is introduced inside the interspace 23 by means of a valve member 8 arranged preferably in the rear part of the tank 2 (fig. 2A). </p><p id="p0036" num="0036"> [30] More precisely, the tank 2 consists in a tank body 20 preferably made in a single piece through moulding of transparent plastic material, contained 
<!-- EPO <DP n="8"/>-->
 between a couple of lateral walls 22; obviously it is possible to provide that the tank body 20 is realized in a different way, for example through suitable mechanical working. The tank body 20 has a lower portion 24 having the shape of a cylindrical sector extending along a substantially horizontal axis and an upper portion 25 which extends from the aforesaid cylindrical portion 24. The upper portion 25 of the tank body 20 is provided with an upper opening 12 suitable to be closed by a lid 10 (fig. 3). To the lid 10 is suitably superimposed a profiled carter 1 1 which defines an interspace with respect to the same lid 10. Alternatively it is possible to provide that the lid 10 and the carter 1 1 are made integral in a way as to render the aforesaid interspace hermetic. </p><p id="p0037" num="0037"> [31 ] The cylindrical portion 24 extends above a base plate 26, having a substantially rectangular shape, shaped by the same tank body 20. In mounting position such a base plate 26 results suitably distanced from the upper surface of the base body 9 of the apparatus (see again fig. 3). </p><p id="p0038" num="0038"> [32] The tank body 20 has frontally a front closure wall 27 shaping the cited sleeve 28 of the dispenser device 5. More precisely, the sleeve 28 intersects a profiled portion 28a protruding from the lower part of the front wall 27. </p><p id="p0039" num="0039"> [33] Suitably the front wall 27 has, at the upper portion 25 of the tank body 20, a curved portion 27a inclined towards the inside of the tank to direct towards such an end the product which has interacted with the mixing device 3, in a way as to avoid stagnations of the product in the upper angles of the same tank. On its turn the lid 10 is provided, above said inclined wall 27a, with a 
<!-- EPO <DP n="9"/>-->
 curved portion 10a which constitutes a prolongation of the same inclined portion of the wall 27 of the tank, to allow the product to gradually change direction. </p><p id="p0040" num="0040"> The front wall 27 extends in front of a further wall 29 shaped by the tank body 20, suitably spaced therefrom, specifically suitable to close frontally the cylindrical portion 24, as specified in the following. </p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The tank body 20 is arranged between a couple of lateral walls 22 which are equally obtained through moulding of transparent plastic material. The lateral walls 22 are made hermetically integral, along the upper longitudinal edge, to a rim 13 which surrounds the upper opening 12 of the tank body 20 and, along the lower longitudinal edge, to the base plate 26 of the same tank body 20, in a way as to contain the cited interspace 23 (see fig. 6). The lateral walls 22 are also made hermetically integral, along the front and rear vertical edges, to the front wall 27 of the tank body 20 and to corresponding edges of a rear wall 30 of the same tank body 20 (see fig. 7). </p><p id="p0042" num="0042">It is to be observed that the cited further wall 29 integral at the front side to the tank body 20 defines on its turn with respect to the front wall 27 an interspace in communication with the interspace defined between the same tank body 20 and the lateral walls 22. </p><p id="p0043" num="0043"> The functioning of the apparatus for preparing and dispensing refrigerated products, such as crushed-ice drinks, ice creams, sorbets and the like, turns out to be easy to understand from the preceding description. </p><p id="p0044" num="0044">After introducing the product in the tank 2, through the upper opening 12, the preparation cycle is activated. In particular the cooling device 4 is 
<!-- EPO <DP n="10"/>-->
 automatically activated, setting the suitable working temperatures, and the screw member of the mixing device 3 is actuated in rotation at a predetermined rate. The suitable temperature sensor, arranged inside the tank 2 preferably in proximity of the front wall, periodically controls the temperature of the product. When required, dispensing of the product is performed by actuating the obturator member 6 of the dispenser device 5 in opening position through the lever member 7. </p><p id="p0045" num="0045"> [39] The insulated walls of the containment tank for the product allow to limit the thermal dispersion between the inside of the tank, maintained at a low temperature by the device for cooling the product in preparation, and the external environment. </p><p id="p0046" num="0046"> [40] In particular the cylindrical portion 24 and the upper portion 25 of the tank body 20 constitute the internal wall 21 of the tank 2 for containing the product. Such an internal wall 21 is integrally insulated by means of the interspace 23 defined by the lateral walls 22 which hermetically close themselves on the tank body 20. </p><p id="p0047" num="0047"> [41 ] The apparatus in hand therefore attains the scope of performing in an optimal manner the preparation and dispense of refrigerated products, such as crushed-ice drinks, ice creams, sorbets and the like, avoiding that a considerable part of the product refrigerating power of the apparatus to be dispersed in the environment. This causes minor consumptions and so an evident energetic saving and minor operating costs of the apparatus, further to an improvement of its general performances, to the advantage of the ecologic character of the apparatus. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="11"/>-->
 [42] This allows in particular to not frequently activate the cooling members for the product, once the maintenance step is reached. </p><p id="p0048" num="0048"> [43] A characteristic of the apparatus in hand is that of allowing the preparation of refrigerated products also with elevated external temperatures. </p><p id="p0049" num="0049"> [44] Another advantage offered by the apparatus in hand is to avoid the formation of condensate or ice on the walls of the tank, made in transparent material, ensuring a pleasant esthetical aspect and making the vision of the product inside the tank always possible. The absence of condensate further makes the application of luminous or adhesive material made elements on the walls of the tank possible, as an example for promotional purposes. </p><p id="p0050" num="0050"> [45] It is to be observed that the easy regulation of the parameters which influence the preparation of the product enable to control in the most appropriated manner the characteristics of the dispensed product, for example when the external temperature varies. The constant quality of the dispensed product is therefore warranted. </p><p id="p0051" num="0051"> [46] Another characteristic of the apparatus in hand is that of allowing to dispense a wide variety of products. </p><p id="p0052" num="0052"> [47] The apparatus described for indicative purpose is susceptible of numerous modifications and variants according to the diverse exigencies. </p><p id="p0053" num="0053"> [48] In figures 8 - 12 is illustrated a different embodiment of the containment tank 2 which allows to insulate also the part of the dispenser device 5 interested, during use, by the presence of the product to be dispensed. In particular in the cited figures 8 - 12 the tank body 20 lacking the lateral walls 22 is illustrated, to better point out the conformation thereof. Such an 
<!-- EPO <DP n="12"/>-->
 insulation is obtained by means of an increase of the dimensions of the profiled portion 28a intersected by the sleeve 8 of the dispenser device 5. Practically the profiled portion 28a results protruding from the lower part of the front wall 27 of the tank for a tract sufficient to incorporate the lower tract of the sleeve 8 which is in communication with the inside of the cylindrical portion of the tank 2. The profiled portion 28a defines with respect to a corresponding tract 29a of the internal wall 29 an insulation interspace, indicated again with 23 for clarity. </p><p id="p0054" num="0054"> [49] It is to be observed that the base plate 26, the front wall 27 and the profiled portion 28a of the tank body 20 realize in substance a continuous profile on which the lateral walls 22 are welded, on opposite sides, in a way as to define the cited hermetically closed interspace 23 (see in particular fig. 8). Such a continuous profile also comprises the rear wall 30, wherein the mouth of the cylindrical portion 24 is opened, and the upper rim 13 of the opening 12 for introducing the product.
