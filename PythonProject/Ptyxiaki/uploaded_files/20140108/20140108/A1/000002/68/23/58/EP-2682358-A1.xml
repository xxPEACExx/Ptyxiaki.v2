After the web has been fully wound up on one of the bobbins, the extended end of the web from the bobbin is cut and then the turret is rotated by 180 degrees to exchange the web wound-up bobbin for an empty bobbin thereby to press the end portion of the web onto the empty bobbin for smoothly winding the web on the bobbin. According to this winding apparatus, since the turret has to be rotated by 180 degrees with the weighty web fully wound up bobbin, the apparatus tends to be formed relatively in a large size. Further, since the weighty web wound up bobbin is supported on the turret, the turret has to be rotated with a lower speed, which may lead to longer bobbin exchange time.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">On the other hand, <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP3506818B"><text>JP3506818B</text></patcit> (<patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP9063565A"><text>JP9-063565A</text></patcit>) discloses a web winding apparatus which is provided with a rotating disc rotatably provided on a base board and a pair of arm members provided at the both sides of the board and each arm member is projected from the board. A pair of empty bobbins is detachably and rotatably supported on each tip end of the arm members. One of the tip ends of the arm members is set to a web winding position and the other of the tip ends is set to be a winding waiting position. When the bobbin supported on the one of the tip ends of the arm members becomes fully wound state by the web, the rotating disc is rotated by 180 degrees to have the fully wound bobbin to be set to the winding waiting position and the other empty bobbin to be set<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> to the web winding position. Then, the web portion extending from the fully wound bobbin is pressed on the other empty bobbin and is cut. Then the end portion of the web is wound on the empty bobbin. According to this winding apparatus, after exchange of the web fully wound bobbin for an empty bobbin, the extended portion of the web from the fully wound bobbin is pressed onto the empty bobbin to be cut and then the cut end portion thereof is wound on the empty bobbin. This can continuously perform the web winding process, thereby to shorten the time necessary for winding.</p><heading id="h0004">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">However, according to the web winding apparatuses disclosed in the above <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="JP2807857B"><text>JP2807857B</text></patcit> (<patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="JP7101604A"><text>JP7-101604A</text></patcit>) and <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="JP3506818B"><text>JP3506818B</text></patcit> (<patcit id="pcit0008" dnum="JP9063565A"><text>JP9-063565A</text></patcit>), a rotating disc is provided which includes a rotatable turret and arm members for exchanging the web fully wound bobbin for an empty bobbin. These apparatuses become complex in structure and large in overall size.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">This invention was made considering the above issues of the related art and it is an object of the invention to provide a web winding apparatus which is small in size and simple in construction.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">(Claim 1) The web winding apparatus associated with the invention is <b>characterized in that</b> the apparatus comprises two bobbins on which a web is wound, a cutter transferrable between the two bobbins and cutting the web to be transferred and two web pressing members each provided at each side of the cutter and swingable such that when one of the two web pressing members approaches the cutter, the other of the two web pressing members backs away from the cutter, the two web pressing members being transferrable between the two bobbins, wherein the two web pressing members are formed such that upon swinging, the two web pressing members move towards an empty bobbin at the side of the one of the two web pressing members which has been backed away from the cutter and upon swinging, the one of the two web pressing members which has approached the cutter presses an end portion of the web to be cut by the cutter on the empty bobbin thereby to wind the end portion of the web on the empty bobbin.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">(Claim 2) Further, the two bobbins are rotatably supported on respective central axes thereof and rotatable in opposite directions to each other, the cutter is rotatable in the same direction with respective rotation directions of the two bobbins, the two web pressing members are rotatable in<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> the opposite directions to the rotation directions of the respective empty bobbins on which the end portion of the web has been pressed. The apparatus is further <b>characterized in that</b> by rotating one of the web pressing members synchronizing with the rotations of the corresponding one of the empty bobbins and the cutter at a predetermined position where the one web pressing member has approached the one empty bobbin, the end portion of the web which is to be cut by the cutter is wound on the one empty bobbin.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">(Claim 3) Further the web pressing members are formed so that the end portion of the web which has been fully wound on the other of the two bobbins is wound on the one bobbin which is empty.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">(Claim 4) Two cutter receiving members are provided at respective sides in web transfer directions of the two web pressing members and swingable with the two web pressing members for cutting the web with the cutter by sandwiching the web giving a pressure together therewith.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">(Claim 5) Web supporting members for supporting the web to be transferred are rotatably provided at respective sides of two pairs of the web pressing members and the cutter receiving members and swingable with the two pairs of the web pressing members and the cutter receiving members.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">(Claim 6) Further, the two pairs of the web pressing members, cutter receiving members and the web supporting members are arranged to form a V-shape.</p><heading id="h0005">EFFECTS &amp; ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">(Claim 1) According to the invention in claim 1, the cutter and one of the two web pressing members approach one empty bobbin of the two bobbins and cut an end portion of the web under transferring by the cutter and press the cut end of the web onto the empty bobbin thereby to wind the web on the empty bobbin. This structure can eliminate a complex and large sized bobbin exchange device and propose the web winding apparatus which is small in size and simple in structure.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">(Claim 2) Further, the web pressing members, the empty bobbin and the cutter are formed such that the web to be transferred can be rotated in synchronized rotation speed therewith and can be cut and wound on the empty bobbin. This can achieve a highly precise web transfer<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> operation and at the same time can prevent the web from occurrence of any cutting failure or winding failure caused by inaccurate transfer operation.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">(Claim 3) Further, the web pressing members are formed such that the end portion of the web which has been fully wound on one of the two bobbins is wound on the other empty bobbin. According to this structure, the removing of the fully wound bobbin and attaching of the empty bobbin can be alternately performed, which can improve web winding efficiency.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">(Claim 4) Further, the cutter and the cutter receiving members are formed such that the web is firmly sandwiched by the cutter and the cutter receiving members and is accurately cut thereby to wind the web on the bobbin successfully.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">(Claim 5) Still further, the web supporting members support the web to be transferred so that the web can be smoothly transferred without being loosened by applying appropriate tension on the web. This can prevent the web from entrapment into the web pressing members or the cutter.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">(Claim 6) Further, the bent portion of V-shaped swinging members is set to be the swinging center and accordingly, when the web pressing members are moved to the empty bobbin, the web pressing member, which has been backed away from the cutter upon swinging, can escape from the empty bobbin outside thereof without interfering with the empty bobbin. Thus, the web pressing member which has approached towards the cutter upon swinging can surely press the end portion of the web to be cut by the cutter on the empty bobbin and wind the web thereon.</p><heading id="h0006">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ATTACHED DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0018" num="0018">Various aspects of this invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments, when read in light of the accompanying drawings, in which:
