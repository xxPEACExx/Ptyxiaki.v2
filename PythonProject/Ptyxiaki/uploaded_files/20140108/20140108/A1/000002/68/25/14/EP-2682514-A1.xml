This rigid tubular body may be furthermore structured<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> for resting on a number of idle supporting rollers which are arranged at the two axial ends of the tubular body locally parallel to the drum longitudinal reference axis, and are fixed to the boxlike casing in free revolving manner so as to allow the tubular body to freely rotate about its horizontally-oriented longitudinal reference axis. The circular front rim of the tubular body surrounds the laundry loading/unloading opening and is coupled in substantially airtight and axially rotating manner to the front wall of the boxlike casing; whereas the circular rear rim of the tubular body abuts against the rear wall of the boxlike casing and is coupled in substantially airtight and axially rotating manner directly to said rear wall.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The closed-circuit, hot-air generator in turn comprises: an air recirculating conduit which extends on the bottom of the boxlike casing and has a first end directly connected to a first air-vent realized in the rear wall of the boxlike casing, within the perimeter of the rear rim of the tubular body, and a second end directly connected to a second air-vent realized on the annular frame that delimits the laundry loading/unloading opening on the front wall of the casing; and an electrically-powered centrifugal fan which is located along the air recirculating conduit and is structured to produce an airflow which flows in closed loop through the air recirculating conduit and the rotatable drum.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The stream of hot air produced by the hot-air generator generally enters into the tubular body via the first air-vent realized in the rear wall of the boxlike casing, flows inside the tubular body for the entire length of the latter, and finally comes out of the tubular body via the second air-vent realized on the annular frame that delimits the laundry loading/unloading opening on the front wall of the casing.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The closed-circuit, hot-air generator furthermore comprises: an air-cooling device which is located along the air recirculating conduit, and is structured to cool the moist air arriving from the rotatable drum, so as to cause the condensation of the surplus moisture inside the airflow; an air-heating device which is located along the air recirculating conduit, downstream of the air-cooling device, and which is structured for heating the dehumidified airflow arriving from the air-cooling device and directed back to the rotatable drum, so that the airflow directed back into the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> rotatable drum is heated to a temperature preferably, though not necessarily, higher than or equal to that of the moist air flowing out of the same rotatable drum.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The closed-circuit, hot-air generator is finally provided with an air-filtering member which is arranged along the air recirculating conduit, upstream of the air-cooling device, to prevent the fluff and/or lint particles from reaching and clogging up the air-cooling device, the air-heating device and the centrifugal fan.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In some of the rotary-drum household laundry dryers currently on the market, the air-filtering member consists in a substantially wedge-shaped filtering cartridge which is fitted in removable manner into the air-vent realized on the annular frame that delimits the laundry loading/unloading opening on the front wall of the casing, so to cover/close the whole air-vent. Thus, when the porthole door is in the wide-opened position, the user is allowed to manually extract the wedge-shaped filtering cartridge from the air-vent realized on the annular frame that delimits the laundry loading/unloading opening for periodical cleaning.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="DE8437357U1"><text>DE8437357U1</text></patcit> discloses a wedge-like filtering cartridge for laundry driers which consists in a substantially bag- or pocket-shaped rigid shell which has a V-shaped cross section and is dimensioned for being inserted/plugged into the air-vent realized on the annular frame that delimits the laundry loading/unloading opening, so as to cover/close the whole air-vent. This bag-shaped rigid shell is furthermore divided into two or four valve-like pieces which are laterally hinged to one another, so that the rigid shell is openable in a book-like or leaflet-like manner. The flat central portion of each valve-like piece is provided with a large throughout opening which is completely covered with a close-mesh net capable to restrain the fluff and/or lint particles within the bag-shaped rigid shell.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Unluckily, periodical cleaning of the <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="DE8437357U1"><text>DE8437357U1</text></patcit> wedge-like filtering cartridge is particularly unpleasant to the user because the particular structure of the filtering cartridge allows the fluff and/or lint particles to accumulate on opposite faces of the inner and outer valve-like pieces, creating several problems at opening of the filtering cartridge.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Aim of the present invention is to provide a laundry dryer having an air-filtering<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> cartridge which is easier to clean.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In compliance with the above aims, according to the present invention there is provided a laundry dryer having an air-filtering cartridge as claimed in Claim 1 and preferably, though not necessarily, in any one of the dependent Claims.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">A non-limiting embodiment of the present invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:

The substantially cylindrical-shaped, rigid tubular body 3 is furthermore preferably structured for resting on a number of idle supporting rollers 8 which are arranged approximately at the two axial ends of the tubular body 3 with their rotation axis locally substantially parallel to the longitudinal reference axis L of tubular body 3, and are fixed to the boxlike casing 2 in free revolving manner so as to allow the tubular body 3 to freely rotate about its longitudinal reference axis L inside the boxlike casing 2. Even if it is here described a drum supported by rotatable rollers, it should be understood that the present invention covers also an arrangement wherein the drum is supported by a shaft<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> mechanically connected to the drum rear wall, i.e. the wall opposite to the drum front wall which is provided with an opening for loading/unloading laundry into/from the drum.
