It essentially consists of a fitting between respectively tapered and enlarged male/female parts with a conical profile. More generally, a conical coupling between pipe elements is also called "Morse cone" after the name of the inventor.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">For example in the field of pipes having small thickness, like chimney flues, it is known to make a conical fitting between metal sheet elements, where in substance a conically tapered male part engages a conically enlarged female part, and the two male/female parts have the same angle of conicity.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Such a conical fitting is simple to realize but suffers from some drawbacks. In fact, the joint must keep a tight seal, i.e. avoid leakage of gas or condensate in a liquid state; at the same time the joint must ensure mechanical resistance to extraction (seizure). Moreover, the fitting must not require an excessive force, which could deform the tube and would cause obvious assembly difficulties.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">It has been noted that a quite large angle of conicity is preferable for the purpose of the tight seal; a large angle of conicity however makes the assembly harder and increase the risk of deformation of the surfaces; moreover, if the conical section is somewhat long, a relatively large angle of<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> conicity increases the size of the joint due to the enlargement of the female part.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">For these reasons, the choice of the angle of conicity up to now has always been the result of a compromise, and as such is not fully satisfactory. In some cases, it has been noted that the tight seal is insufficient and in any case it is necessary to provide a gasket, sealant paste or similar. The use of a gasket or similar does, however, introduce limitations and drawbacks: the gasket or other element can age early, may not be able to withstand too high or too low temperatures, and may be difficult to replace.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>Summary of the invention</u></heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">The invention proposes to overcome the aforementioned limitations of the prior art, by providing a new conical fitting. The new fitting is particularly suitable for metal sheet pipes, like for example chimney flues, gutters or pipes for the transportation of liquid and gaseous fluids</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Said purpose is accomplished with a conical fitting system for elements of a pipe, wherein each pipe element comprises a substantially cylindrical or elliptical tube section, a conically tapered male end, and a conically enlarged female end, and where the male end of a generic first element can be inserted in a female end of an adjoining second element, to make the fitting between the two elements, <b>characterised in that</b>:
<ul><li>the male end, starting from the end section of the element, comprises a first longitudinal portion having a first angle of conicity, and a second longitudinal portion having a second angle of conicity smaller than said first angle,</li><li>the female end, starting from the end section of the element, comprises a longitudinal entrance portion with angle of conicity equal to said second angle, and an inner longitudinal portion, with angle of conicity equal to said first angle.</li></ul><!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The fitting according to the invention has, in other words, a double conicity on both the male element and the female element. The male and female elements have a symmetrical conicity, i.e. the conicity of the end portion of the male corresponds to the conicity of the most inner portion of the female end, and at the same time the mouth portion of the female end has the same conicity as the most inner portion of the male.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Indeed, the applicant has found that the seizure effect (mechanical resistance to extraction) is suitably ensured even by a quite small angle of conicity, i.e. less than 1° and for example of the order of 0.25°. Starting from this consideration, the applicant came to the idea of a coupling with a double conicity, wherein a coupling with small conicity provides the seizure, and another coupling with a greater conicity ensures the tight seal to gas and liquids. The first angle of conicity can be called sealing angle, and the second angle can be called seizure or anti-extraction angle.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The great advantage of the invention, in other words, is that there are substantially two conical couplings dedicated respectively to the fluid-tight and mechanical seal Therefore, it is no longer necessary to seek a compromise solution as occurs in the prior art.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">For example, it should be noted that the inner part of the coupling with smaller conicity (e.g. 0.25°) makes it possible to have a sufficiently large contact surface and to ensure the required mechanical seal, without on the other hand widening too much the diameter and/or causing excessive difficult of assembly. On the other, hand, it is possible to adopt an advantageously larger angle of conicity (e.g. 1.5°) in the region intended for the tight seal.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The angles of conicity and the length of the respective portions of the male and female end can be determined upon the specific requirements in terms of seal, strength, the diameter of the tube and the conditions of use (temperature, pressure, etc.).<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Said first angle of conicity is advantageously comprised between about 1° and 2°, and preferably it is about 1.5°.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Said second angle of conicity is advantageously less than 1°; preferably it is comprised between about 0.2° and 0.5°, and even more preferably it is about 0.25°.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The applicant has found that a fitting according to the invention between tubes made from metal sheet of a small thickness (0.4 - 1.5 mm) is able to ensure the tight seal without a gasket even at a pressure of 5000 Pa, thus being suitable for use in chimney flues or similar. The tight seal, indeed, is provided substantially by the elasticity of the material (metal sheet of small thickness). The possibility of making a seal without a gasket or other non-metallic element is an important advantage because it eliminates a component which is subject to ageing and which sooner or later need replacement.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Another advantage of the invention is that it avoids widening the female tube too much, as occurs in the prior art adopting a single conical part with opening angle for example of 2 degrees. Said advantage is appreciable particularly in pipe elements having a large diameter, in which the length of the tapered part is also considerable. The length of the conical parts (male and female), indeed, is substantially proportional to the diameter; for example the conical part is about 100 mm long for a diameter of 900 mm.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">According to a preferred aspect, the male end comprises a depression or throat in the transition area between the first and the second portion with different angles of conicity. This depression substantially prevents parts having different conicity from overlapping, since in this case there would be a risk of deformation that would hinder the seal against pressures and condensate. In other words, it prevents the inner part of the male (with smaller conicity) from working in contact with the inner part of the female, having greater conicity. Said depression or throat preferably has a diameter,<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> at the throat section, that is smaller than the diameter of the adjoining conical portions.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The female end preferably comprises at least one protrusive ribbing, and preferably a double ribbing. The presence of at least one ribbing is useful for stiffening the pipe element, and during the machining step it prevents the expulsion of the piece to be worked from the expanding tool; a double ribbing also defines a housing seat that is useful for per se known locking systems like a flange, a strap, etc.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The conical ends can be obtained for example with the process known as "belling", i.e. with an expansion tool. One of the advantages of the invention is that, by working both the male and female elements in expansion, possible small differences in the diameter, thickness, ovalization, etc. between single tubular elements are produced in series are compensated. Moreover, the present invention makes it possible to make a joint between two elements with slightly different thickness or diameter from one another, in any case ensuring the seal against pressure and condensate. Small differences in thickness and/or diameter can be due to admissible tolerances and the joint compensates for such differences; this clearly represents a great advantage for modular (assemblable) pipe systems.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Preferably, the elements are made from metal sheet. This term is intended to mean metal sheet of steel and/or other alloys.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Preferred applications of the invention are represented by: chimney flues, gutters, ventilation channels, pipes for similar uses, usually made from metal sheet of steel or other alloys with small thickness. Other applications for example are represented by: tubings, smoke channels, flanged elements (also insulated) for generators, for metallic chimneys for taking, transporting and diffusing air that has been or is to be processed, etc.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Another object of the invention is a modular pipe system suitable for making chimney flues, smoke channels and the like, comprising pipe elements with a conical fitting system as outlined above.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The advantages will become more evident with the help of the following description and the figures, in which:

The elements 10, 20 have a substantially cylindrical part respectively 1, 9 with a certain nominal diameter, and fitting portions denoted with 11, 21. The pipe parts 1 and 9 are depicted simply as a rectilinear cylindrical tube, but they can equally comprise a bend, a tee, or other. The section can be circular or elliptical. Depending on the embodiments, the elements can be insulated if necessary.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The fitting portions have a conical profile that is tapered or enlarged with respect to the nominal diameter. The element 10 in greater detail ends with a conically tapered male end 11, which can be fitted in the female end 21 of the element 20, which is conically widened.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The male end 11, starting from the end section 12 of the element itself, comprises a first longitudinal portion 4 that is tapered with angle of conicity β<sub>1</sub>, and a second longitudinal portion that is tapered with an angle of conicity β<sub>2</sub> &lt; β<sub>1</sub>. For example β<sub>1</sub> is about 1.5° whereas β<sub>2</sub> is about 0.25°. The first angle β<sub>1</sub> is called the sealing angle and the second angle β<sub>2</sub> is called the seizure angle.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The female end 21, starting from the respective end section 22 of the element 20, comprises a longitudinal entrance portion 7 that is enlarged with angle of conicity equal to said seizure angle β<sub>2</sub>, and an inner longitudinal portion 8, also conically enlarged but with angle equal to said sealing angle β<sub>1</sub>.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The male-female parts of the joint, in other words, have a double symmetrical conicity, since by moving from the end section 12, 22, respectively, one encounters the conicity β<sub>1</sub> - β<sub>2</sub> in the male 11, and symmetrically β<sub>2</sub> - β<sub>1</sub> in the female 21, being β<sub>2</sub> &gt; β<sub>1</sub> as stated above.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">By fitting the elements into one another, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, the portion 4 freely passes in the wider first section 7, but forms a conical (sealing) coupling when meeting the part 8. At the same time, a conical (seizure) coupling is made when the portion 2 meets the surface 7.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The figures also show some preferred features. The male end 11 has a groove 3 interposed between the portions 2 and 4 having different conicity. Said groove 3 prevents accidental overlap, during the fitting, of the parts having different conicity, for example the parts 2 and 8 with size error tolerance (+/-) given by the size of the groove. As can be noted in the figures, the groove 3 defines a minimum section of the pipe element, the diameter measured at the throat of said groove being less than the diameter of the adjoining conical parts 2 and 4.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The female end 21 has two ribbings 5 and 6, which form a double ribbing with a region 23 for housing a locking means. Said locking means, although not essential, can be provided, according to what is needed, to increase the seizing effect, and may consist of a flange, strap or other.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In some embodiments, the elements can be insulated.
