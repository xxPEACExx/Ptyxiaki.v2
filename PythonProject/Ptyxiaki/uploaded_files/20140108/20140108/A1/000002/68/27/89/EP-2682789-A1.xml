In a collecting lens 101 of the configuration shown in <figref idrefs="f0015">Fig. 15</figref>, light rays incident at a certain angle δ to the rotational axis C become parallel to the rotational axis C of the hyperboloid surface 120 within the collecting lens 101, and are focused aplanatically on a focal point F. The angle δ is an angle satisfying Snell's law, or in other words, sin (θ + δ) = nsinθ given n as the refractive index of the collecting lens 101. Thus, with the collecting lens 101 shown in <figref idrefs="f0015">Fig. 15</figref>, it is possible to suppress the occurrence of off-axis<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> aberrations and collect light rays efficiently from directions oblique to the normal line H of the flat surface 110.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The collecting lens 101 disclosed in Patent Document 1 is designed for infrared light rays, and Patent Document 1 discloses using polyethylene as the lens material.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Patent Document 1 also describes a multi-segment lens with an array of a plurality of collecting lenses all having a focal point in the same position.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0016">Figs. 16A and 16B</figref>, moreover, Patent Document 1 also proposes making collecting lens 101 a Fresnel lens, and making the common rotational axis C of hyperboloid surfaces 121, 122 and 123 of the second surface intersect the flat surface 110 (the first surface) obliquely in order to suppress the occurrence of off-axis aberrations.

The work piece 140 is a base material for forming the collecting lens 101 directly, or a base material for forming the mold.

This lens surface 21 is divided into lens function surfaces 23 bounded by virtual faces VP, which cross the direction of lens thickness, and forming different angles with the virtual faces VP. From a different perspective, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, the second surface 20 side of the collecting lens 1 has a structure such as would be obtained by stacking layers 25<sub>1</sub> and 25<sub>2</sub> on either side of one virtual face VP in the direction of lens thickness, eliminating the boundary between layers 25<sub>1</sub> and 25<sub>2</sub>, stacking layers 25<sub>2</sub> and 25<sub>3</sub> on either side of another virtual face VP, and eliminating the boundary between layers 25<sub>2</sub> and<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> 25<sub>3</sub>.

The apex of each elliptical cone 30 here is located on the second surface 20 side of the lens, while the base (not shown) is located on the first surface 10 side. Moreover, the central axis (not shown) of each elliptical cone 30 intersects a particular normal line at each point on the first surface 10 obliquely. When the direction connecting a point on the first surface 10 and the point where the particular normal line at that point crosses the lens function surface 23 is specified as the direction of lens thickness in the collecting lens 1, the direction along the particular normal line at each point on the first surface 10 is the direction of lens thickness if the first surface 10 is a flat surface. Because the first surface 10 is a flat surface in the collecting lens 1 of the present embodiment, the central axis of each elliptical cone 30 intersects the<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> direction of lens thickness obliquely.

In the case of incident light oblique to the direction of lens thickness of the collecting lens 1, moreover, the transmittance may be excessively low because the optical path becomes even longer than the maximum lens thickness of the collecting lens 1.

As in Embodiment 1, the optical axis (not shown) of collecting lens 1 of the present embodiment intersects the direction of lens thickness (vertical direction in <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref>) obliquely (at an angle). This collecting lens 1 defined as Fresnel lens 1 has central lens part 1a and a plurality of (two in the example shown) ring-shaped lens parts 1b surrounding the central lens part 1a. The number of ring-shaped lens parts 1b is not particularly limited, and may be three or more.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">Each ring-shaped lens part 1b has a peak 11b on the second surface 20 side of the lens 1 (see <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7</figref>).

Thus, the second surface 20 of the Fresnel lens 1 has a lens surface 21 on each ring-shaped<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --> lens part 1b.

When the direction connecting a point on the first surface 10 and the point where the normal line at that point crosses lens function surface 23 is defined as the direction of lens thickness in the collecting lens 1, the direction along the normal line at each point on the first surface 10 is the direction of lens thickness if the first surface 10 is a flat surface. Because the first surface 10 is a flat surface in the collecting lens 1 of the present embodiment, the central axis of each elliptical cone 30 intersects the direction of lens thickness obliquely.

However, the prior conditions for determining the values for the coefficients a, b and c shown in Table 3 are that the incident light rays are focused on the focal point F at an incident angle of 45°, with 10 mm as the distance d from an image plane I parallel to the first surface 10 of the collecting lens 1 to a reference plane (the flat plane containing the valleys of peaks 11b) parallel to<!-- EPO <DP n="43"> --> the first surface 10. The relative positional relationships of apices P<sub>01</sub>, P<sub>02</sub>, P<sub>11</sub>, P<sub>12</sub>, P<sub>21</sub> and P<sub>22</sub> can be expressed for example in terms of the coordinates (X, Y and Z) of apices P<sub>01</sub>, P<sub>02</sub>, P<sub>11</sub>, P<sub>12</sub>, P<sub>21</sub> and P<sub>22</sub>, using an orthogonal coordinate system having the focal point F of the collecting lens 1 as the origin, with the x axis and the y axis bisecting each other at right angles on the image plane I containing the focal point F, and the Z axis specified in the direction perpendicular to the image plane 1.

A "large curvature radius" here means a curvature radius that is large enough for the first surface 10 to appear as a flat surface, but the curvature radius of the first surface 10 may be designed appropriately based on the lens radius of the collecting lens 1 and the like.</p><p id="p0118" num="0118">That is, if the curvature of the first surface 10 is designed within a range at which off-axis aberrations do not exceed an allowable value (for example, no more than the size of photoelectric conversion element 2 above) in the collecting lens 1 made of polyethylene, it is possible to both suppress off-axial aberrations and control the occurrence of sink marks and swelling even while reducing the lens thickness. In this Description, forms including first surfaces 10 having such a curvature and first surfaces 10 having a flat surface are called flat first surfaces 10.
