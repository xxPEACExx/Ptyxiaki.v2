The first vehicle body panel 32 and the second vehicle body panel 34 are respectively configured by steel plates. The first vehicle body panel 32 is formed with a hat shaped cross-section profile open towards a second vehicle body panel 34 side. The second vehicle body panel 34 is formed in a flat plate shape, and forms a closed cross-section portion together with the first vehicle body panel 32. An adhesion flange structure 10 according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention is applied to the first vehicle body panel 32 and the second vehicle body panel 34.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Namely, the first vehicle body panel 32 is formed with a side wall portion 36 that projects up with respect to the second vehicle body panel 34. An end portion at a second vehicle body panel 34 side of the side wall portion 36 is formed with a first flange 14 with a bend portion 12 interposed therebetween. The first flange 14 extends in an L direction along the end portion at the second vehicle body panel 34 side of the side wall portion 36.

The first flange 14 and the second flange 16 are moreover joined together by spot welding at plural welding portions 20. The plural welding portions 20 extend in a row at intervals to each other along the extension direction of the first flange 14 along the end portion at the second vehicle body panel 34 side of the side wall portion 36, namely along the L direction.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The bend portion 12 described above is formed with a ridge projection portion 24 that projects towards a facing portion 22 side of the second flange 16 that faces the bend portion 12.

The thickness of the adhesive 18 between the bend portion 12 and the facing portion 22 can accordingly be reduced due to forming the ridge projection portion 24, thereby enabling the rigidity of the bend portion 12 to be secured.
