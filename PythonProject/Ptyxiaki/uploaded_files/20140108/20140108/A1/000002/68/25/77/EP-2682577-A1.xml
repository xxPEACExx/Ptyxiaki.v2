If the SO<sub>2</sub> is oxidized by the precious metal catalyst of the particulate filter and thus becomes SO<sub>3</sub>, this will react with the moisture in the exhaust gas and become sulfuric acid. Sulfuric acid is low in boiling point and immediately forms mist-like white fumes which can be seen, and therefore if they are released as is into the atmosphere, the vehicle will be seen as one which releases white fumes and the commodity value of the vehicle will fall.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">It has been proposed, in S poisoning reversal processing which releases the SO<sub>X</sub>, which is stored in the NO<sub>X</sub> storage catalyst device, as SO<sub>2</sub>, to make the released SO<sub>2</sub> react with water and liquefy as sulfuric acid and to hold this sulfuric acid mist as iron sulfide at a mist catch plate and thereby suppress release into the atmosphere (for example, see PLT 1).</p><heading id="h0003">Citations List</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007"><ul><li>PLT 1: Japanese Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2007218108A"><text>2007-218108A</text></patcit></li><li>PLT 2: Japanese Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2009138667A"><text>2009-138667A</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">Summary of Invention</heading><heading id="h0006">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">If arranging a mist catch plate like the one disclosed in PLT 1 at the downstream side of a particulate filter, it is possible to sufficiently suppress release into the atmosphere of sulfuric acid fumes which are generated at the time of regeneration processing of a particulate filter.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">However, such a mist catch plate has to be periodically replaced.

The internal combustion engine is for example a diesel engine. In the <figref idrefs="f0001">figure, 1</figref> is a particulate filter for trapping particulate which is contained in exhaust gas. 2 is an oxidation catalyst device which is arranged at an immediate upstream side of the particulate filter 1, while 3 is a catalyst device which is arranged at a downstream side of the particulate filter 1.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The particulate filter 1 is a wall flow type which forms a honeycomb structure which is for example formed<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> from a porous material such as cordierite and has a large number of axial direction spaces which are formed by subdivision by partitions which extend in the axial direction. In two adjoining axial direction spaces, one is closed by a plug at an exhaust downstream side, while the other is closed at the exhaust upstream side. In this way, one of two adjoining axial direction spaces becomes an inflow passage for exhaust gas and the other becomes an outflow passage. The exhaust gas is designed to pass through the partitions. The particulate in exhaust gas is extremely small compared with the size of the pores of the partitions, but collide with and are trapped by the exhaust upstream side surfaces of the partitions and the pore surfaces in the partitions. In this way, the partitions function as walls which trap the particulate.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The particulate which is trapped by the particulate filter 1 makes the exhaust resistance of the particulate filter 1 increase, and therefore before the exhaust resistance of the particulate filter 1 rises to a set value or more and thus the engine output greatly falls, regeneration processing for burning off the trapped particulate must be carried out.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The regeneration processing of the particulate filter 1 is performed by feeding additional fuel to the cylinders from the fuel injectors in the latter half of the expansion stroke or exhaust stroke or feeding additional fuel by a fuel feed device (not shown) which is arranged in the exhaust passage at the exhaust upstream side of the oxidation catalyst device 2, making this additional fuel burn off in the oxidation catalyst device 2, and utilizing this heat of combustion to raise the particulate filter 1 to the combustion temperature of the particulate, that is, about 600°C.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The amount of additional fuel per unit time which flows into the oxidation catalyst device 2 is controlled based on the exhaust gas amount and the exhaust gas temperature which changes due to the current engine<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> operating state (engine load and engine speed). The larger the exhaust gas amount, the greater the amount of additional fuel per unit time, while the higher the exhaust gas temperature, the smaller the amount of additional fuel per unit time. Due to this, the temperature of the exhaust gas which flows into the particulate filter 1 is controlled to about 600°C. It is also possible to measure the temperature of the exhaust gas which flows into the particulate filter 1 and perform feedback control on the amount of additional fuel per unit time which flows into the oxidation catalyst device so that this measurement temperature becomes about 600°C. If in this way the temperature of the exhaust gas which flows to the particulate filter 1 becomes about 600°C, it is possible to make the particulate which is trapped at the particulate filter 1 burn from the exhaust upstream side of the particulate filter 1 toward the exhaust downstream side and possible to easily make the trapped particulate completely burn.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Further, even if the oxidation catalyst device 2 is omitted, if the particulate filter 1 carries platinum or another precious metal catalyst, it is possible to make the additional fuel which was controlled in amount in the same way as above burn at the particulate filter 1 and use this heat of combustion to raise the particulate filter 1 to about 600°C to perform the regeneration processing. In this case, the precious metal catalyst is carried on the exhaust upstream side surfaces of the partitions of the particulate filter 1 using alumina etc. as a carrier. Further, even when an oxidation catalyst device 2 is provided, to suppress the release into the atmosphere of the additional fuel which slips through the oxidation catalyst device 2, it is desirable to make the particulate filter 1 carry a precious metal catalyst using alumina etc. as a carrier so as to make the additional fuel burn.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0026" num="0026">If, in this way, the particulate filter 1 is provided with an alumina carrier, the SO<sub>2</sub> in the exhaust gas is adsorbed on the alumina carrier. The SO<sub>2</sub> which was adsorbed on the alumina carrier is released if the particulate filter reaches a high temperature such as 600°C at the time of the regeneration processing. Substantially all of the released SO<sub>2</sub> is oxidized by the precious metal catalyst of the particulate filter 1 to become SO<sub>3</sub>. If becoming SO<sub>3</sub> in this way, this reacts with the moisture in the exhaust gas to become sulfuric acid. Sulfuric acid is low in boiling point and immediately forms mist-like fumes which can be seen if left untreated and released into the atmosphere, and therefore the commodity value of the vehicle falls.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">To suppress the release into the atmosphere of the sulfuric acid fumes which are generated at the time of regeneration processing of the particulate filter 1, an exhaust purification system according to the present invention arranges a catalyst device 3 at the immediate downstream side of the particulate filter and controls the feed of additional fuel at the time of regeneration processing by an electronic control unit (digital computer) in accordance with the first flowchart which is shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The catalyst device 3 is comprised of a honeycomblike substrate on the surface of which zirconium oxide (ZrO<sub>2</sub>) or cerium oxide (CeO<sub>2</sub> or Ce<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) or another catalyst which can hold sulfuric acid as a sulfuric acid salt is coated. In particular, a precious metal catalyst which has an oxidation function is not carried.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The first flowchart of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> will be explained below. First, at step 101, the amount of SO<sub>2</sub> adsorption AS which is adsorbed per unit time at the particulate filter 1 in the current engine operating state is estimated by, for example, using the map which is shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>. The map shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is set with the amount of SO<sub>2</sub> adsorption AS to the particulate filter 1 per unit time<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> for each engine operating state (combination of engine load L and engine speed NE) found experimentally. The SO<sub>2</sub> in the exhaust gas is mainly generated by oxidation of the sulfur contained in the fuel. The greater the amount of fuel injection in the engine operating state, the greater the amount of SO<sub>2</sub> adsorption AS per unit time.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Next, at step 102, the amount of SO<sub>2</sub> adsorption AS is cumulatively added to calculate the current amount of SO<sub>2</sub> adsorption A of the particulate filter 1.

On the other hand, when the particulate filter reaches a high temperature (about 600°C) for the regeneration processing and the set amount A1 of SO<sub>2</sub> is totally released from the particulate filter 1, the released SO<sub>2</sub> becomes sulfuric acid as explained above. The set amount A1 is set so that all of this can be held at the catalyst device 3 as a sulfuric acid salt. That is, the greater the amount of sulfuric acid which the catalyst device 3 can hold, the greater the set amount A1 can be set. However, when the amount of SO<sub>2</sub> adsorption A of the particulate filter 1 reaches the set amount A1, the trapped amount of particulate of the particulate filter 1 has to be prevented from increasing exhaust resistance of the particulate filter 1 to a set value or more.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The regeneration processing of step 104, as explained above, feeds additional fuel to maintain the<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> particulate filter 1 at about 600°C. At step 105, it is judged if the duration "t" of the regeneration processing has reached the time t' required for burning off all of the trapped particulate at the time of start of regeneration processing (the greater the set amount A1 of the SO<sub>2</sub> adsorption amount A, the greater the amount of trapped particulate at the time of start of regeneration becomes, and therefore the required time t' becomes longer). The regeneration processing is performed until this judgment becomes affirmative. If the judgment of step 105 is affirmative and the regeneration processing is completed, at step 106, temperature elevation control of the catalyst device 3 is performed.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">As explained above, during the regeneration processing for burning off the trapped particulate of the particulate filter 1, the set amount A1 of SO<sub>2</sub> is released and becomes sulfuric acid, but substantially all is held at the catalyst device 2 as a sulfuric acid salt, ant therefore release of fumes of sulfuric acid into the atmosphere can be sufficiently suppressed.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">If the catalyst of the catalyst device 2 is zirconium oxide (ZrO<sub>2</sub>), as the sulfuric acid salt, zirconium sulfate Zr(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> is formed. The temperature elevation control of step 106 is designed to increase the amount of additional fuel per unit time used for the regeneration processing of the particulate filter 1 in the different engine operating states so that exhaust gas of about 700°C flows into the catalyst device 3. Due to this, the zirconium sulfate Zr(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> is broken down by heat as follows:<br/>

</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The catalyst device 3 does not have an oxidation function. The SO<sub>2</sub> which is formed at this time is not oxidized to SO<sub>3</sub> which is easily oxidized to sulfuric acid. The SO<sub>2</sub> which is released from the particulate filter 1 can be released into the atmosphere not as sulfuric acid<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> but finally as SO<sub>2</sub>. In this way, the zirconium oxide (ZrO<sub>2</sub>) reacts with sulfuric acid to generate a sulfuric acid salt at the temperature of the regeneration processing of the particulate filter 1, that is, about 600°C, or less.

The rich control feeds additional fuel to the cylinders or the exhaust passage at the upstream side of the oxidation catalyst device 2 (by method similar to regeneration processing of particulate filter 1) so that the air-fuel ratio of the exhaust gas reaches the desired rich air-fuel ratio (or stoichiometric air-fuel ratio) with respect to the combustion air-fuel ratio of the current engine operating state, and sufficiently lowers the oxygen concentration in the exhaust gas after passing through the oxidation catalyst device 2 and particulate filter 1.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">If, in this way, the oxygen concentration in the catalyst device 3 falls, the zirconium sulfate Zr(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> or cerium sulfate Ce(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> of the catalyst device 3 tries to release oxygen, is easily broken down in the same way as the above heat decomposition, and releases SO<sub>2</sub>.<br/>
