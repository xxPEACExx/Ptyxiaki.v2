Instead of the average value, the median value of the degree of similarity between the respective movement information, the maximum value of the degree of similarity between the respective movement information, and the minimum value of the degree of similarity between the respective movement information may be the degree of similarity between the rhythm information of the first additional electronic device 100 and rhythm information of the second additional electronic device may be used.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">A timing at which the calculation unit 20 starts the calculation of the degree of similarity is not particularly limited.

More specifically, in a case where the degree of similarity between the rhythm information of the first additional electronic device 100 and the rhythm information of the second additional electronic device calculated by the calculation unit 20 is equal to or higher than a predetermined threshold, the grouping unit 30 groups the first additional electronic device 100 and the second additional electronic device 100 into the same group.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">For example, with regard to the electronic devices A, B, and C, the grouping unit 30 groups the electronic devices A, B, and C into the same group in a case where the degree of similarity between the rhythm information of the electronic devices A and B is equal to or higher than the predetermined threshold, the degree of similarity between the rhythm information of the electronic devices A and C is equal to or higher than the predetermined threshold, and the degree of similarity between the rhythm information of the electronic devices B and C is equal to or higher than the predetermined threshold.

The housing of the electronic device 1 (or the electronic device 100) holds the display unit 40 and a sensing unit 22.</p><p id="p0209" num="0209">The display unit 40 is disposed on a plate surface of the housing. The surface of the housing where the display unit 40 is disposed is hereinafter referred to as a display surface.</p><p id="p0210" num="0210">The sensing unit 22 is disposed on four side surfaces Fa to Fd which correspond to four sides of the housing surrounding the display surface. The sensing unit 22A is disposed on the side surface Fa, the sensing unit 22B is disposed on the side surface Fb, the sensing unit 22C is disposed on the side surface Fc, and the sensing unit 22D is disposed on the side surface Fd. The sensing units 22A to 22D detect the presence or absence of contact (for example, with the user) from outside each side surface Fa to Fd and the contact positions (areas). With regard to what is common to all of the sensing units 22A to 22D, the A to D marks will be omitted to refer to the sensing unit as the 'sensing unit 22' or 'each sensing unit 22.'</p><p id="p0211" num="0211">When the user grips the electronic device 1 (or 100), each sensing unit 22 senses the position of the finger (contact position) of the user which is in contact with each side surface. The detection unit 14 (or 114) acquires the information of the contact position sensed by each sensing unit 22 as the rhythm information. Specifically, the detection unit 14 (or 114) detects the gravity direction by an acceleration sensor (not shown), determines the vertical direction so that the gravity direction is the downward direction, and determines the direction orthogonal to the vertical direction as the horizontal direction (horizontal direction when the display unit 40 is viewed from the front). The<!-- EPO <DP n="79"> --> detection unit 14 (or 114) has the information of the contact position on each side surface in the vertical and horizontal directions as the rhythm information. The calculation unit 20 calculates the degree of similarity between the contact positions on the respective side surfaces in the vertical and horizontal directions as the degree of similarity between the rhythm information. For example, the calculation unit 20 calculates the distance between the contact position of the first electronic device 100 and the contact position of the second electronic device 100 on the respective side surfaces in the vertical and horizontal directions, and increases the degree of similarity as each calculated distance is short and decreases the degree of similarity as each calculated distance is long.</p><p id="p0212" num="0212">Alternatively, the detection unit 14 (or 114) may generate an index (grip pattern) of the contact position detected by each sensing unit 22 and may acquire the index as the rhythm information.</p><p id="p0213" num="0213"><figref idrefs="f0028">FIGS. 21A and 21B</figref> are images showing an example of each grip pattern that is the index of the contact position.

The pattern 2 shown in <figref idrefs="f0028">FIG. 21B</figref> shows a grip on the upper and lower side surfaces. The detection unit 14 (or 114) determines the grip pattern based on the contact position detected by each detection unit 22 and acquires the determined pattern as the rhythm information. For example, the detection unit 14 has the pattern 1 as the grip pattern in a case where the contact positions are on the left and right side surfaces, and has the pattern 2 as the grip pattern in a case where the contact positions are on the upper and lower side surfaces. The calculation unit 20 increases the degree of similarity of the electronic device I (or 100) having the same pattern and decreases the degree of similarity of the electronic device 1 (or 100) having different patterns. In other words, the grouping unit 30 groups the electronic device 1 (or 100)<!-- EPO <DP n="80"> --> having the same pattern into the same group. In this manner, the amount of processing for the calculation of the degree of similarity by the calculation unit 20 is reduced as the detection unit 14 (or 114) acquires the grip pattern.</p><heading id="h0014">Reference Signs List</heading><p id="p0214" num="0214"><dl id="dl0001" compact="compact"><dt>1</dt><dd>ELECTRONIC DEVICE</dd><dt>10</dt><dd>ACQUISITION UNIT</dd><dt>12</dt><dd>RECEPTION UNIT</dd><dt>14</dt><dd>DETECTION UNIT</dd><dt>20</dt><dd>CALCULATION UNIT</dd><dt>22</dt><dd>SENSING UNIT</dd><dt>30</dt><dd>GROUPING UNIT</dd><dt>40</dt><dd>DISPLAY UNIT</dd><dt>50</dt><dd>TRANSMISSION UNIT</dd><dt>60</dt><dd>OPERATION CONTROL UNIT</dd><dt>90</dt><dd>RHYTHM INFORMATION STORAGE UNIT</dd><dt>92</dt><dd>CONNECTION INFORMATION STORAGE UNIT</dd><dt>94</dt><dd>GROUPING INFORMATION STORAGE UNIT</dd><dt>96</dt><dd>OPERATION CONTROL INFORMATION STORAGE UNIT</dd><dt>100</dt><dd>ELECTRONIC DEVICE (ADDITIONAL ELECTRONIC DEVICE)</dd><dt>114</dt><dd>DETECTION UNIT</dd><dt>140</dt><dd>DISPLAY UNIT</dd><dt>150</dt><dd>TRANSMISSION AND RECEPTION UNIT</dd><dt>160</dt><dd>OPERATION CONTROL UNIT<!-- EPO <DP n="81"> --></dd><dt>196</dt><dd>OPERATION CONTROL INFORMATION STORAGE UNIT</dd><dt>2</dt><dd>ELECTRONIC DEVICE</dd><dt>18</dt><dd>IMAGING UNIT</dd><dt>16</dt><dd>RHYTHM INFORMATION GENERATION UNIT</dd><dt>290</dt><dd>RHYTHM INFORMATION STORAGE UNIT</dd><dt>292</dt><dd>CONNECTION INFORMATION STORAGE UNIT</dd><dt>294</dt><dd>GROUPING INFORMATION STORAGE UNIT</dd><dt>296</dt><dd>OPERATION CONTROL INFORMATION STORAGE UNIT</dd><dt>200</dt><dd>ELECTRONIC DEVICE (ADDITIONAL ELECTRONIC DEVICE)</dd><dt>118</dt><dd>IMAGING UNIT</dd><dt>116</dt><dd>RHYTHM INFORMATION GENERATION UNIT</dd></dl></p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56982286" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="82"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>An electronic device comprising:
