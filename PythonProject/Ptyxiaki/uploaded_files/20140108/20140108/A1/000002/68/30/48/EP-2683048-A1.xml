In order to drive such a motor vehicle with electricity, it is necessary to charge the mounted secondary battery from an external charger. The capacity of the secondary battery mounted on the motor vehicle varies according to a use of the vehicle. However, the capacity of a secondary battery of the electric vehicle positioned as replacing means for the conventional automobile mounted with the internal combustion engine tends to be large. The secondary battery has a capacity of, for example, several ten kWh. When such a large-capacity secondary battery is charged, large electric power is consumed if it is attempted to complete the charging in a short time. On the other hand, electric power continues to be consumed for a long time if the secondary battery is charged with reduced consumed power.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">As an example of the conventional charging control, Patent Document 1 discloses a method of providing a single charging controller with real-time information concerning a power load other than a charger in a house, predicting power load fluctuation, calculating, from maximum contract power and a power load prediction value, electric power that can be used for charging, and performing charging control such that charged electric power does not to exceed the calculated electric power.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Patent Document 2 discloses a charging device that simultaneously charges a plurality of secondary batteries in parallel. The disclosed device includes a plurality of direct-current stabilizing power supply circuits and a switching unit. The device determines a combination of the direct-current stabilizing power supply circuits on the basis of information from the secondary batteries and switches a switch of the switching unit to control charged power to the plurality of secondary batteries.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Patent Document 3 discloses a charging system that simultaneously charges batteries of a plurality of battery-driven vehicles. The system includes one or more DC-DC power converters, one or more charging ports of which can be connected to the batteries. The DC-DC power converters are selectively connected<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> to a plurality of charging ports to selectively supply a higher port power level. The DC-DC power converters are connected to an AC rectifier through a DC bus. The AC rectifier is connected to an AC power supply having a limited power rating. The AC charging system controls the operation of the DC-DC power converters such that total power absorption in the AC rectifier does not exceed the power rating.

One charger is assumed. However, it is also possible that a plurality of chargers are placed in a place where a large number of people can use the chargers such as a gas station. Power control for the plurality of chargers cannot be handled simply by providing the chargers with information concerning power loads other than the chargers.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Patent Document 2 is based on the premise that maximum allowable consumed power of a charger is fixed. The maximum allowable consumed power is distributed to the plurality of secondary batteries. However, this method has a problem explained below. The charger is set in a store such as a gas station. However, since electric power used in the store is used by electrical installations such as lights and air conditioners other than the charger as well, the maximum allowable consumed power that can be allocated to the charger fluctuates at every moment. Therefore, when the maximum allowable consumed power of the charger is fixed without taking into account consumed power of the other electrical installations and the switching by the switching unit is simply performed, it could occur that electric power the contract power and the supply of the electric power is interrupted or an excess rate is charged. Further, various users use the charger. A charger installation contractor desires to set a service level corresponding to characteristics of a user. However, fine control cannot be performed simply by using the information from the secondary batteries as described in Patent Document 2.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In Patent Document 3, the operation of the DC-DC power converters is<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> controlled such that the total power absorption in the AC rectifier does not exceed the power rating. However, conversion efficiency of electric power is not taken into account at this point. In general, conversion efficiency of AC/DC and DC/DC is set to maximize efficiency during a rated output. Therefore, it is desirable to determine allocated electric power to maximize the conversion efficiency. However, the conversion efficiency is not taken into account in Patent Document 3.</p><heading id="h0002">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">Therefore, it is an exemplary object of the present invention to efficiently perform, in an environment in which a plurality of chargers operate simultaneously with electrical installations other than the chargers, charging by the plurality of chargers within a range of remaining allowable power excluding used power of the other electrical installations.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">A charged power control system according to the present invention includes: a plurality of chargers; a switchboard configured to receive electric power from a power network and supply the electric power to the plurality of chargers and electrical installations other than the chargers; a first power measuring unit configured to measure consumed power of the electrical installations other than the chargers; a second power measuring unit configured to measure consumed power of the respective chargers; an AC/DC conversion unit configured to convert the electric power supplied from the switchboard from an alternating current into a direct current and supply the resulting electric power to the chargers; and a power control unit configured to determine allocated power to the charger on the basis of the consumed power of the other chargers and the electrical installations other than the chargers and conversion efficiency of the AC/DC conversion unit.

Further, the charger 2-1 notifies the motor vehicle 3-1 of ability information such as the maximum allowable power value and an output voltage range and an output current range of the charger 2-1 and determines a charging condition between the charger 2-1 and the motor vehicle 3-1.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">When the charging condition is determined, charging processing is started between the motor vehicle 3-1 and the charger 2-1. The charger 2-1 periodically notifies the server 40 of a charging state. Upon receiving the charging state, the server 40 performs the power allocation calculation again when consumed power of the charger 2-1 tends to decrease. The server 40 notifies the charger 2-1 of a calculated maximum allowable power value. When the maximum allowable power value is updated, the charger 2-1 determines a charging condition again between the charger 2-1 and the motor vehicle 3-1 and continues the charging processing.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Thereafter, the same processing is executed when the motor vehicle 3-2 is connected to the charger 2-2 and when the motor vehicle 3-3 is connected to the charger 2-3.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> is a flowchart of the operation of the power control unit 403 of the server 40. The power control unit 403 monitors presence or absence of a connection notification of a charger and a motor vehicle, presence or absence of a charging state notification, presence or absence of a decrease in a current value in the notified charging state information, charging completion, and the like and switches the operation according to a situation.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Upon receiving a connection notification of a charger (S301: YES), the power control unit 403 acquires information concerning the charger from the charger-information saving unit 406 (S302) and acquires, from the policy-information saving unit 402, policy information set by an operator operating the charger (S303).<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> Subsequently, the power control unit 403 acquires, from the power-contract-information saving unit 405, power contract information of a place where the charger is set (S304). Further, the power control unit 403 acquires an electrical installation consumed power history from the power managing unit 404 (S305).</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Thereafter, the power control unit 403 calculates allocated power on the basis of the acquired information (S306) and notifies the charger of the calculated allocated power (S307).

In this embodiment, it is assumed that, as policy information, a policy for sequentially allocating surplus power to chargers in order of connection of motor vehicles to the chargers is set. Maximum contract power is assumed to be 50 kw. <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> shows changes in consumed power of chargers in the case in which charging is sequentially started in three chargers. <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref> shows an example of recorded contents of the power management table at respective points of (1) to (7) shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">A state in (1) of <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> is a situation in which no charger is used and electric power is consumed by only electrical installations other than the chargers. As shown in (1) of <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>, consumed power of the electrical installations at this time is 4 kw.

As shown in (2) of <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>, consumed power of the electrical installations at this time is 2.3 kw. Maximum allowable power of the electrical installations is 6 kw. Since the motor vehicle 1 is connected to the charger 1, the server 40<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> calculates power allocation to the charger 1, notifies the charger 1 of the power allocation, and updates the power management table. As shown in (2) of <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>, maximum allowable power of the charger 1 is 44 kw. According to the policy, the server 40 allocates, to the charger 1, 44 kw obtained by subtracting the maximum allowable power 6 kw of the electrical installations from the maximum contract power 50 kw.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">A state in (3) of <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> is a state in which the server 40 receives a charging state from the charger 1. As shown in (3) of <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>, the consumed power of the electrical installations and the consumed power of the charger 1 are updated at this time. The consumed power of the charger 1 recorded in the power management table is a measured value in an interface portion with the motor vehicle. Actually, a value obtained by taking into account conversion efficiency of the variable constant current circuit 202 and the AC/DC conversion unit 104 is consumed power in the proximity of the switchboard 101. Since time elapses between the state (2) and the state (3), a value of the maximum allowable power of the electrical installations also changes to 2 kw. The conversion efficiency of the AC/DC conversion unit 104 and the variable constant current circuit 202 is designed such that efficiency is maximized during a rated output. For example, the rated output is set to 50 kW. When an output is 50 kW, the conversion efficiency is 90%. When an output is 20 kW, the conversion efficiency drops to 80%.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">When calculating allocated power, the power control unit 403 determines the allocated power taking into account the conversion efficiency of the AC/DC conversion unit 104 and the variable constant current circuit 202.

As shown in (4) of <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>, the consumed power of the electrical installations and the consumed power of the charger 1 are updated. Since a charging current value of the charger 1 does not decrease, the maximum allowable power allocated to the charger 1 is not changed.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">A state in (5) of <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> is a state in which a motor vehicle 2 is connected to a charger 2.

The server 40 receives charging state notifications from the chargers. Information concerning the charging state notifications is reflected on the power management table. Since charging current values of both the charger 1 and the charger 2 do not decrease, the maximum allowable powers allocated to the charger 1 and the charger 2 do not change. Therefore, there is no surplus power. Power allocation to the charger 3 is zero.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">A state in (7) of <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> is a state in which, for example, when a rechargeable battery of a motor vehicle is a lithium ion battery, the rechargeable battery enters a constant voltage charging region of constant current-constant voltage charging. Since the consumed power of the charger 1 starts to decrease, surplus power is generated in the maximum allowable power allocated to the charger 1. The generated surplus power is allocated to the charger 2 and the charger 3. Since the consumed power of the charger 1 decreases from 38 kw to 32.3 kw, consumed power in the proximity of the switchboard 101 is about 36 kw (=32.3/0.9). Therefore, the maximum allowable power of the charger 1 is set to 36 kw. Surplus power of 8 kw is equally distributed to the charger 2 and the charger 3 to set the maximum allowable powers of the charger 2 and the charger 3 respectively to 8 kw and 4 kw.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">As explained above, according to this embodiment, it is possible to flexibly change the allocate power to the plurality of chargers according to a change in the consumed power of the electrical installations other than the chargers and the consumed power of the chargers.

In the following explanation in a second embodiment, a policy for allocating non-zero maximum allowable power to all chargers in advance is assumed.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">For example, maximum allowable power of 5 kw is allocated to the chargers in advance. In the first embodiment, since surplus power is zero when the motor vehicle is connected to the charger 3, electric power is not allocated to the charger 3. However, by allocating a part of contract power to the respective chargers in advance,<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> it is possible to prevent a state in which, even if a motor vehicle is connected to a charger, the motor vehicle is not charged and a user waits.</p><heading id="h0007">Third Embodiment</heading><p id="p0045" num="0045">In the first embodiment, the policy for equally distributing, when surplus power is generated, the surplus power to the plurality of chargers is used. In a third embodiment, a distribution ratio of surplus power is changed according to user attributes.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">For example, when a user of the charger 2 is a member of a charging service and a user of the charger 3 is a non-member of the charging service, a policy for distributing surplus power to the member and the non-member at a ratio of 2:1 is assumed.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">That is, in the first embodiment, in the state in (7) of <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref>, a decrease of the consumed power of the charger 1 is equally distributed to each of the chargers 2 and 3 by 4 kw.
