That duct ends each carry a jacket which is mounted tight to said duct ends. Said jackets each comprise at least two annular ribs between which a first annular sealing element, such as an O-ring, is mounted which in turn is engaged on its upper side by an inner shell of the coupling device according to the present invention.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Particularly, said coupling device includes an outer shell which may comprise two interconnected shell sections, each having radially inwardly extending ribs or rib sections, which are either arranged in an axial direction of a further annular rib of that jackets, or, on the other hand, radially inwardly extending rib or rib sections engage an axial recess provided in that jacket, that axially extending recess defined between said further annular rib and an additional fourth annular rib provided on said jackets.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The solution according to the present invention allows the duct ends to relatively move with respect to each other without loosing the fluid tight connection, since - due to the axial distance between the ribs of the outer shell and the further rib on the jacket - an axial movement is feasible. In the alternative, inwardly extending radially ribs, preferably arranged at the end portions of said outer shell or that outer shell sections, respectively,<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> may engage into a recess which is defined - in axial direction - between said further annual rib and an additional fourth rib arranged on the outer circumference of said jackets. Due to both alternatives of the present invention an axial movement of said confronting duct ends is feasible. This means, that a maximum gap width of a few millimeters can be allowed and as well as a "face to face" - arrangement between said duct ends in the mounted stage. Further to the relative movements within a horizontal plane, the solution according to the present invention allows for angled orientations of said duct ends with respect to one another. By this, mounting tolerances or the mounting of said coupling device according to the present invention is significantly easier, since duct ends can be mounted in an angled orientation with respect to one another, which is much more easier for the assembling personal to handle.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Preferably, the coupling device according to the present invention, comprises a second annular shaped sealing element which either is arranged on the outer circumference of said jacket or which may be provided on the inner conference of said jackets. In an alternative embodiment, both sealing elements, i.e. the first and the second annular shaped sealing element may be arranged on the outer circumference of said jackets, each of the sealing elements being housed by annular ribs and each of the sealing elements covered by an inner shell of the coupling device according to the present invention.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">It is worthwhile mentioning, that the duct ends and the jackets tightly arranged on the outer circumference of said duct ends are manufactured of plastic material which allows for a significant reduction of weight of these components, when compared to solutions using metal components. Basically, said duct ends and said jackets tightly arranged on the outer circumference of said duct ends are made of a high-performance thermoplastic material such as PEEK and PPS to name but a few. The material chosen, i.e. said thermoplastic material is resistant against aggressive liquids and resistant in terms of not deformable with respect to a wide temperature range between -50°C and 100°C. The high performance plastic material may be reinforced by fibers or by glass fibers to give an example.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Preferably, the outer shell is made of two shell sections which are connected with one another within connecting regions. To achieve this, said shells made of plastic material are provided with elastic hook-shaped elements which snap into openings of the complementary shell section to be connected with. To increase mechanical stability of the coupling device said outer shell or said outer shell section, respectively, surround said inner shell of the coupling device in its entirety i.e. about 360 °, seen in circumferential direction. In its mounted stage, said outer shell is surrounded by at least one or two cable ties which may easily be fixed around the outer circumference of the outer shell and exert a<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> significantly clamping force onto the coupling device in its mounted stage. Said shells are like parts, i.e. the shell, being clamped identical, each being provided with an opening on one end and on the other hand having an elastically hooked-shaped element.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">To allow for an easy inspection of the connecting areas between confronting duct ends which are fixed by the coupling device according to the present invention, said outer shell may comprise on its outer circumference a number of openings. Said openings allow for an easy inspection of the inner shell. Said inner shell may comprise on its outer circumference a ribbed structure on the one hand to reduce weight and on the other hand to reinforce said component. Depending on the ribbed structure being formed on the outer circumference the mechanical reliability or the mechanical rigidity of said component can be defined upon design thereof.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">A further feature of the present invention worthwhile mentioning are the jackets which are tightly fastened on the circumference of said duct ends. To this end, said jackets may be laser welded with said duct ends or glued onto said duct ends. In the alternative a glue-fill-in-opening is provided on the circumference of said jackets to inject glue from the outer surface of jackets into the annular gap between the duct ends and the inner circumference of said jackets. Said jackets comprise markers, which may be manufactured in a substantially triangular shape. This allows to identify the relative position of a jacket - which is tightly mounted on the circumference of the duct end - with respect to the coupling device. If a larger part of said markings being shaped in triangular fashion can be recognized by an inspection person, this indicates a larger gap width between said confronting duct ends connected by the coupling device. If, however, only a small part of said triangularly shaped markers, on both sides of the rim of the coupling device is visible for inspection persons, this indicates a stage of said confronting duct ends, which is close to a "face to face" position of said duct ends. Further, if only the markers of only one jacket of the duct ends is visible, and the markers of the opposite jacket of the respective opposite duct ends are not visable, indicates to an inspection personal, that the connection of both fronting duct ends is assymetrical.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In each of the stages sketched above, the two annular sealing elements, i.e. commonly O-rings, manufactured of an elastic material, provide for a fluid tight connection of said fluid carrying duct ends even if said duct ends have moved with axial direction or in angular orientation with respect to one another. The axial length of the outer shell of the coupling device according to the present invention allows for axial displacement of said duct ends with respect to each other as well as of angular displacement of said duct ends to be releasably connected to one another.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Provided the components of said coupling according to the present invention are made of an electrically conducting material and provided the annular shaped O-rings feeding elements are made of an electrically conducting material, an electrical connection is established by means of said coupling according to the present invention. Likewise said coupling made of an electrically conducting material serves the purpose of an electrostatic discharging device. In contrast to coupling devices made of a metallic conductive material, which use generally flat rectangular connectors, this is not necessary with the coupling device according to the present invention, where the components form the electrical conductors themselves.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The coupling device according to the present invention allows for a much safer handling upon mounting, it is very flexible and may compensate for relative movements of the duct ends connected in a fluid-tight manner.

The maximum gap width 110 is reached, when on both jackets 14, 16 with respect to the axially extending recess 103 the first width portion 106 reaches its maximum value and simultaneously said second width portion 108 becomes zero.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">If, however, said second width portion 108 on both jackets 14, 16 adopts the value zero, then said coupling device 18 endeavors its maximum axial tension load and the mechanical force is transmitted by the following components: beginning with the first duct end 10 to said tightly mounted first jacket, further by the third annular rib 54 to said inner ribs 40 of said outer shell 20 via the other inner rib 40 at the opposite end of said outer shell 20 to the corresponding third annular rib 54 of the jacket 16 of the other duct end 12. This operating condition is best shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 12.1</figref>.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">In the case that the coupling is axial compression loaded, both first width portions 106 simultaneously intend to become zero, the gap width 44 reaches, before this occurs, the value zero. Therefore the load path can be easily determined as the following components:<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --></p><p id="p0054" num="0054">Via first duct end 10, to first jacket 14 to the end face 60 of the first duct 10, the end face 62 of the second duct end 12 to the second jacket 16 and the second duct end 12.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">In a third scenario the second width portion 108 becomes zero as well as the first width portion 106. Then an extreme asymmetrical position is reached. To limit this extreme asymmetrical position the fourth annular rib 102 pushes against said radially inward extending rib or rib portion 40 of said outer shell 20 to move the whole coupling 18 into a more an ideal position. In the various embodiments described heretofore, said annular-shaped sealing elements 46, 58 and 59 may serve different purposes, even in combination with each other:</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">Said sealing elements listed above, i.e. components 46, 48 and 159, respectively, may be used for redundancy purposes as well as in the sense of a task separation. Whereas one of the three sealing elements serves the sealing function, the other one may establish electrical conductivity whereas the third sealing element may be arranged for redundancy purposes only. The sealing function concerns the separation of the medium transported and the glue, i.e. this is the case when the jackets 14, 16 are tightly fitted by means of an adhesive to the duct ends 10, 12. This separation of functions can thus be seen in connection with the second sealing element 58, when arranged in the inner recess as shown in the embodiment according to <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 3</figref>. In this embodiment according to <figref idrefs="f0002">figure 3</figref> said second sealing element 58 has a sealing function between the duct ends 10, 12, i.e. the medium transported therein and the outer jackets 14, 16. If, however arranged on the outer circumference on said jackets 14, 16, said sealing element 59 may adopt the function of establishing electric conductivity. Both sealing elements i.e. the second sealing element 58 as well as the sealing element 59 may be used in a parallel i.e. at the same time in a coupling devise according to the present invention.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">The ideal position of the coupling 18 according to the present invention will be realized during installation by adjusting said gap 42 to a predetermined value.

These deformations may occur from aircraft fuselage deformation, thermal expansion behavior or any other reason. While compensating deformations, the coupling 18 according to the present invention could reach one of the above-mentioned extreme positions.
