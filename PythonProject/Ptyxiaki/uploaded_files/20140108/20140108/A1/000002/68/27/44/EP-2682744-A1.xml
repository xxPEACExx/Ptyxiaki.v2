num="0001">The present invention relates to a data processing device and data processing program that are intended to convert a value actually measured by gas chromatographic analysis to a value appropriate for comparison or the like.</p><heading id="h0002">Background Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">A sample qualitative experiment using only gas chromatographic analysis is adapted to inject, for example, a sample desired to be qualified, and a compound as a reference substance, which is expected to be the sample desired to be qualified, into a column with a syringe or the like, and compare respective retention times that are times required for a detector to detect constituents of them. For example, in the case where the respective retention times regarding the constituents are coincident with each other, it can be identified that the sample desired to be qualified is identical to the reference substance.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Meanwhile, a retention time is influenced by a parameter such as a column length or linear velocity of carrier gas, and therefore even if a sample desired to be qualified is coincident with an expected reference substance, in<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> the case where different gas chromatographs or different experimental conditions were used to made measurements, respective retention times are different. That is, in such a case, even in the case of comparing the two retention times with each other, a quality determination cannot be made.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">For this reason, in order to be able to prevent the influence of the parameter as described above, and qualify of a substance desired to be qualified, retention indices are compared with each other. To describe more specifically, a retention index is one that is not influenced by many of experimental conditions in gas chromatographic analysis as compared with a measured value such as a retention time, and easily made to serve as a target for comparison at the time of quality determination. For this reason, for example, NIST and the like collect a number of retention indices for each compound, and organize them as a library, and a retention index of a registered substance that is stored in the library and expected to be a sample desired to be qualified, and a retention index that is actually measuring on the sample desired to be qualified are compared with each other to make a quality determination (see Non-patent Literature 1).</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Meanwhile, although not being influenced by a column length, linear velocity, or the like, if temperature conditions such as a setting temperature at the time of perform gas chromatographic analysis are different, even retention indices respectively take different values. For this reason, in the case of actually measuring a retention index of a sample desired to be qualified, a retention index of a reference substance expected to be the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> sample desired to be qualified, which is included in the library, and a temperature condition at the time when the retention index in the library was actually measured are preliminarily obtained, and the temperature condition is set for a gas chromatograph to actually measure the retention index of the sample desired to be qualified.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">However, in the case where a sample desired to be qualified is an unknown sample of which composition and the like cannot be expected at all, which registered substance registered in the library should be referred to be unknown, and therefore a temperature condition at the time of performing gas chromatographic analysis cannot be determined in advance. In addition, the temperature condition of the gas chromatographic analysis is appropriately changed for each registered substance, or depending on specifications of a system for the analysis, separation accuracy of a desired constituent, or the like, and therefore retention indices registered in the library are actually measured in various temperature conditions. Accordingly, even in the case of, for the unknown sample, setting a temporary appropriate temperature condition to actually measure a retention index, and using the actually measured value to search the library, a retention index of a registered substance completely irrelevant to the unknown sample is extracted, or other result is obtained, and therefore it is very difficult to identify the unknown sample. In other words, in the currently used retention index library, it is possible to uniquely search for a retention index from a registered substance name; however, in the case of reversely searching a registered substance name or the like from a retention<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> index, a plurality of registered substances are outputted, or in some cases, nothing is outputted because a coincident retention index is not present in the first place. Accordingly, it is considered that even in the case of identifying the unknown sample only by the gas chromatographic analysis, the number of uncertainties is large, and therefore certain identification cannot be made. As evidence of this, for identification of an unknown sample of which identity cannot be expected at all, not only the gas chromatographic analysis, but other analysis such as mass analysis like GC/MS analysis or the like is also typically performed together.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In addition, as a way to handle the case where a temperature condition in the gas chromatographic analysis is different, as disclosed in Patent Literature 1, converting a measured retention time to a retention time, which is registered in the library and under a temperature condition under which the retention time was measured, to make a quality determination is described; however, a method for converting some retention index to a retention index under a predetermined temperature condition is not described as expected. That is, up to now, a method that can qualify an unknown sample even in the case where a parameter such as a temperature condition or linear velocity is different has not been known.</p><heading id="h0003">Citation List</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">Patent Literature 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2091565A"><text>JP-A02-91565</text></patcit></p><heading id="h0005">Non Patent Literature</heading><!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --><p id="p0009" num="0009">Non Patent Literature 1:

Such findings have been made only by getting out of a wrong impression that an unknown sample cannot be identified only by gas chromatographic analysis, and it is necessary to combine with other analysis, as well as setting a technical issue in which a temperature condition-related problem about a retention index should be examined.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Such a data processing device for a gas chromatograph converts to a retention index under a desired temperature condition if there are a plurality of retention indices actually measured for each registered substance, and therefore it is not necessary to, when gas chromatographic analysis is performed on an unknown sample to actually measure a retention index, preliminarily set a temperature condition so as to enable comparison as before. That is, even in the case of performing an experiment with making a free temperature condition setting for each gas chromatograph used, retention indices can be compared with each other, and, for example, even in the case of performing a reverse search from a retention index, a unique result can be outputted, so that a registered substance corresponding to an unknown sample can be identified with high accuracy.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">As a specific configuration for, on the basis of a retention index, easily<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> identifying what registered substance an unknown sample is, it is only necessary that the data processing device for a gas chromatograph is one further provided with: a known RI data storage part that stores known RI data on each of a plurality of registered substance; a post-conversion RI data storage part that stores retention indices of at least of registered substances with relating corresponding specific identifiers to the retention indices, the retention indices being converted by the known RI data conversion part; a receiving part that receives the predetermined temperature condition, and a value related to a retention index actually measured on an unknown sample by gas chromatographic analysis using the predetermined temperature condition; and a search part that extracts, from among pieces of post-conversion RI data stored in the post-conversion RI data storage part, post-conversion RI data including a retention index of which a value is coincident with or substantially equal to the value of the retention index of the unknown sample under the predetermined temperature condition, the retention index of the unknown sample being received by the receiving part, and outputs an identifier corresponding to the extracted retention index.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Specific configurations of the known RI data conversion part that can make the number of known retention indices to be used smaller than that in an after-mentioned conversion method that requires retention indices at three different temperatures, and is intended to, as compared with the case of making an actual measurement, almost prevent the occurrence of an error to convert to a retention index under a predetermined temperature condition include one in which the predetermined temperature condition is a condition<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> including an isothermal analysis temperature that is appropriately set when gas chromatographic analysis is performed as isothermal analysis; and the known RI data conversion part is configured to, on a basis of retention indices of the registered substance at a first temperature and a second temperature that are two different temperatures, and adjusted retention times of a reference substance at the first temperature, the second temperature, and the isothermal analysis temperature, converts to a retention index of the registered substance at the isothermal analysis temperature. If so, two different retention indices are only required for one registered substance, and even in an existing retention index library, the number of registered substances of which retention indices measured at two or more different temperatures are registered is predominantly larger than the number of registered substances of which as many as three retention indices are registered, so that a database having a larger number of reference objects can be prepared. That is, it is possible to increase the number of search objects, and therefore the possibility of being able to qualify an unknown sample can be further increased.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">As a configuration of the known RI data conversion part that is intended to, when converting from retention indices at two different temperatures to a retention index under a predetermined temperature condition, smoothly perform the sequence of converting from a retention index at some temperature to an adjusted retention time at the some temperature for each registered substance, from which calculating an adjusted retention time under the predetermined temperature condition,<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> and then returning the adjusted retention time to the retention index under the predetermined temperature condition, and thereby easily perform the retention index conversion, it is only necessary that the known RI data conversion part is provided with: a known temperature RT conversion part that, on a basis of retention times of the reference substance at the first temperature and the second temperature, converts from the retention indices of the registered substance at the first temperature and the second temperature to adjusted retention times of the registered substance at the first temperature and the second temperature; an isothermal analysis temperature RT calculation part that, on a basis of a linear relationship between reciprocals of the first temperature and the second temperature, and logarithms of the adjusted retention times of the registered substance, the adjusted retention times corresponding to the first and second temperatures, calculates an adjusted retention time of the registered substance at the isothermal analysis temperature; and an RI calculation part that, on a basis of the adjusted retention time of the registered substance at the isothermal analysis temperature, and the adjusted retention time of the reference substance at the isothermal analysis temperature, calculates the retention index of the registered substance at the isothermal analysis temperature.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">For example, in order to configure known RI data that, without preparing an adjusted retention time or the like of a reference substance, enables a retention index to be converted, it is only necessary that the predetermined temperature condition is a condition including an isothermal<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> analysis temperature that is appropriately set when gas chromatographic analysis is performed as isothermal analysis, and the known RI data conversion part is further provided with: an RI temperature function identifying part that, on a basis of retention indices of the registered substance at a first temperature, a second temperature, and a third temperature that are three different temperatures, identifies three constants of a conversion expression that is a function of temperature and given by an expression below;

In addition, a data processing device for a gas chromatograph 100 in the fourth embodiment converts a known retention index of a registered substance G<sub>n</sub> to retention indices I<sub>TX1</sub>(X) and I<sub>TX2</sub>(X) at the respective isothermal analysis temperatures T<sub>X1</sub> and T<sub>X2</sub> to form a database by the method as described in any of the above first to third embodiments, and then stores the database in the post-conversion RI data storage part 8 in advance. Also, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 10</figref>, the search part 9 is configured to, from the database of the post-conversion RI data storage part 8, search for registered substances G<sub>n</sub><!-- EPO <DP n="40"> --> having retention indices I<sub>TX1</sub>(G<sub>n</sub>) and I<sub>TX2</sub>(G<sub>n</sub>) within ranges of a predetermined value a inclusive with respect to values of the retention indices I<sub>TX1</sub>(X) and I<sub>TX2</sub>(X) of the unknown sample X at the inputted analysis temperatures T<sub>X1</sub> and T<sub>X2</sub> at the time of gas chromatographic analysis of the unknown sample X, and obtain search results as the candidate sets G<sub>TX1</sub> and G<sub>TX2</sub>, respectively.</p><p id="p0085" num="0085">First, assuming that at the first isothermal analysis temperature T<sub>X1</sub>, an adjusted retention time t'<sub>TX1</sub>(X) of the unknown sample X is measured, an unknown sample RI calculation part 3 calculates the first retention index I<sub>TX1</sub>(X) of the unknown sample X from adjusted retention times t'<sub>TX1</sub>(P<sub>Z</sub>) and t'<sub>TX1</sub>(P<sub>Z+1</sub>) of alkanes at the first isothermal analysis temperature T<sub>X1</sub>.

It is here assumed that as the first candidate set G<sub>TX1</sub>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0011">Fig. 11(a),</figref> for example, registered substances G<sub>n</sub> respectively having retention indices within a range of ±10 inclusive with respect to 860.4 that is the value of the<!-- EPO <DP n="41"> --> first retention index I<sub>TX1</sub>(X) are extracted.</p><p id="p0087" num="0087">Then, assuming that at the second isothermal analysis temperature T<sub>X2</sub> that is a different temperature from the first isothermal analysis temperature T<sub>X1</sub>, an adjusted retention time t'<sub>TX2</sub>(X) of the unknown sample X is measured, the unknown sample RI calculation part 3 calculates the second retention index I<sub>TX2</sub>(X) of the unknown sample X from adjusted retention times t'<sub>TX2</sub>(P<sub>Z</sub>) and t'<sub>TX2</sub>(P<sub>Z+1</sub>) of the alkanes at the second isothermal analysis temperature T<sub>X2</sub>. Note that depending on the value of the second retention index I<sub>TX2</sub>(X), the types of alkanes to be used for the calculation may be different from those at the time of calculating the first retention index I<sub>TX1</sub>(X). Also, it is here assumed that the value of the second retention index I<sub>TX2</sub>(X) is, for example, 852.8.</p><p id="p0088" num="0088">Subsequently, the receiving part 4 and the search part 9 perform similar operations to those described above, and thereby the second candidate set G<sub>TX2</sub> at the second isothermal analysis temperature T<sub>X2</sub> is obtained by the search part 9. As a result, it is assumed that the second candidate set G<sub>TX2</sub> as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0011">Fig. 11(b) </figref>is extracted.</p><p id="p0089" num="0089">Finally, the search part 9 extracts a registered substance G<sub>n</sub> common to the first candidate set G<sub>TX1</sub> and the second candidate set G<sub>TX2</sub> to output it as a result Gx of identifying the unknown sample X. That is, in <figref idrefs="f0011">Figs. 11(a) and (b)</figref>, the common element is only a registered substance G<sub>4</sub> indicated by hatched lines, and therefore the unknown sample X is qualified as the<!-- EPO <DP n="42"> --> registered substance G<sub>4</sub>, which is outputted from the search part 9.</p><p id="p0090" num="0090">As described, according to the data processing device for a gas chromatograph 100 in the fourth embodiment, on the basis of retention indices of an unknown sample X under a plurality of different measurement conditions, a plurality of relevant candidate registered substances G<sub>n</sub> can be narrowed down to make a quality determination. Accordingly, even in the case where due to the presence of a measurement error or the like caused by a chromatograph, retention indices are not coincident with each other, a corresponding substance can be identified, and qualifying accuracy of the substance can also be increased.</p><p id="p0091" num="0091">A variation of the fourth embodiment is also described.</p><p id="p0092" num="0092">In the fourth embodiment, as an example of the different measurement conditions, described is the case where the isothermal analysis temperatures are different; however, even in the case where an actually measured retention index results from measurement by temperature rising analysis as described in the third embodiment, a qualifying method in the fourth embodiment can be applied. That is, a plurality of retention indices respectively under different temperature rising analysis conditions may be used to qualify an unknown sample. Also, an unknown sample may be qualified on the basis of two retention indices actually measured under different temperature-related measurement conditions. The present invention may be adapted such that, for example, two retention indices, i.e., a retention index actually measured on an unknown sample at some<!-- EPO <DP n="43"> --> isothermal analysis temperature, and a retention index actually measured at some temperature rising analysis temperature, are used to prepare candidate sets for the retention indices, and the search part outputs one common to the respective candidate sets.</p><p id="p0093" num="0093">Further, an unknown sample may be qualified by using the fact that retention indices measured in the case of different stationary phases respectively take different values. That is, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 10</figref>, the receiving part and the search part may be configured to receive stationary phase types to qualify an unknown sample from retention indices of a registered substance, which were respectively measured with use of the same stationary phases as those used to measure the unknown sample, and the search part may be configured to use a plurality of retention indices of the unknown sample, which were measured with use of different stationary phases, to prepare candidate sets for the respective retention indices, and output a registered substance common to the respective candidate sets.</p><p id="p0094" num="0094">Specifically, an unknown sample may be qualified from a plurality of retention indices measured on the unknown sample in the case where temperature conditions are the same, but stationary phases are different, or from retention indices of the unknown sample, which were measured under the conditions that both of the temperature conditions and the stationary phases are different.</p><p id="p0095" num="0095">In short, it is only necessary that the present invention is adapted to<!-- EPO <DP n="44"> --> be able to, in the case where measurement conditions are set such that actually measured retention indices of an unknown sample take different values, prepare candidate sets from the plurality of retention indices measured under the respective measurement conditions to perform narrowing down.</p><p id="p0096" num="0096">Other embodiments are described.</p><p id="p0097" num="0097">In each of the above-described embodiments, as an example of a reference substance, an alkane is taken to use the so-called Kovats retention index; however, another substance may be used as the reference substance. For example, linear alcohol having a different carbon number in which one hydrogen atom of an alkane is replaced by a hydroxyl group may be used as the reference substance. In each of the above-described embodiments, the known RI data conversion part successively converts a known retention index in each analysis; however, for example, the present invention may preliminarily convert retention indices at temperatures that are potentially used at the time of analysis by a gas chromatograph, and store the converted retention indices in the post-conversion RI data storage part. By doing so, without waiting a time required to convert retention indices, the search part can immediately search for a retention index to shorten a time required to identify an unknown sample. Also, in each of the above-described embodiments, retention indices of all registered substances are converted; however, the present invention may be adapted to convert only registered substances respectively having retention indices that are within a<!-- EPO <DP n="45"> --> predetermined range with respect to a retention index of an unknown sample. That is, the present invention may be adapted to convert retention indices of only registered substance, which may correspond to the unknown sample, among the registered substances by condition settings.</p><p id="p0098" num="0098">Also, as methods for determining the range where retention indices of registered substance stored in the known RI data storage part are converted include a method that determines the conversion range from an adjusted retention time of a reference substance such as an alkane at the time of performing gas chromatographic analysis of an unknown sample. More specifically, at the time of measuring an adjusted retention time of an unknown sample, an adjusted retention time of a reference substance is also measured by the same chromatographic analysis, and in the case where between a first adjusted retention time obtained for an alkane having a carbon number of Z and a second adjusted retention time obtained for another alkane having a carbon number of Z+1, the adjusted retention time of the unknown sample is present, a value of a retention index of the unknown sample can be estimated to be present between Z x 100 to (Z + 1) x 100 from the definitional expression of Expression 6. Accordingly, the present invention may be adapted to convert, among retention indices stored in the known RI data storage part, only retention indices having values between Z x 100 and (Z + 1) x 100, or only retention indices adjacent to the range to retention indices under a predetermined temperature condition.</p><p id="p0099" num="0099">In addition, the present invention may be adapted not to use, among<!-- EPO <DP n="46"> --> the retention indices stored in the known RI data storage part, retention indices having incorrect values or having values by unreliable measurement for the retention index conversion. Specifically, it is only necessary that the known temperature RT conversion part eliminates incorrect values by using the fact that there is a proportional relationship between a logarithm of an adjusted retention time calculated from a retention index of a registered substance and a temperature at the time of measuring the retention index. That is, it is only necessary that the present invention is adapted to prepare a proportional expression on the basis of logarithms of adjusted retention times at two different temperatures, which were converted from retention indices of some registered substance at the two different temperatures, and the two different temperatures; to determine that a retention index not leading to an adjusted retention time at still another temperature even in the case of substituting the temperature into the proportional expression has a value by incorrect measurement or has a unreliable value, and not to use the retention index for the retention index conversion afterward.</p><p id="p0100" num="0100">The receiving part may be adapted to further receive pieces of information on other measurement conditions such as the type of a column, the type of a stationary phase used, and polarity of it. For example, in the case of comparing retention indices with each other, it is desirable that the types of columns, or the types of stationary phases are coincident with each other. Even in the case where the both are not coincident, retention indices respectively measured with use of stationary phases of which polarities are similar to each other may be compared.<!-- EPO <DP n="47"> --></p><p id="p0101" num="0101">For this reason, it is only necessary that the RI conversion part is adapted to convert, among the retention indices stored in the known RI data storage part, retention indices of only registered substances each having data indicating that the type of a registered stationary phase and the type of a stationary phase received by the receiving part are similar to each other. More specifically, it is only necessary that the known RI data storage part stores the types or degrees of polarities of stationary phases used when the retention indices of the registered substances were measured with classifying the types or degrees into four levels of non-polarity, low polarity, intermediate polarity, and high polarity; the receiving part receives which polarity of the four levels polarity of a stationary phase at the time of measuring an unknown sample has; and the RI data conversion part converts only registered substances having retention indices measured with use of stationary phases of which polarity levels are coincident. By doing so, only registered substances highly likely to coincide with the unknown sample can be converted to perform identification with high accuracy while reducing a load on an operation.</p><p id="p0102" num="0102">The known RI data storage part is not limited to one that stores only retention indices actually measured by gas chromatographic analysis under various conditions, but may be one that stores retention indices converted from known retention indices without making actual measurements as described in each of the embodiments. That is, retention indices converted in order to identify an unknown sample may be added to the known RI data<!-- EPO <DP n="48"> --> storage part.</p><p id="p0103" num="0103">The present invention may be adapted to preliminarily calculate retention indices under a number of temperature conditions for each of a number of registered substances from pieces of known RI data; store them in the post-conversion RI data storage part with relating them to corresponding identifiers; and use the stored retention indices together with corresponding identifiers as a database.</p><p id="p0104" num="0104">Also, the data processing device for a gas chromatograph is not necessarily required to be provided together with the gas chromatograph. For example, the data processing device for a gas chromatograph may be used alone, and used in order to be inputted with a retention index obtained by gas chromatographic analysis under some temperature condition and convert to a retention index under another temperature condition.</p><p id="p0105" num="0105">The known RI data storage part may be one that is stored in a storage area inside a computer, or may be a library that is opened in academic organizations through, for example, the Internet or the like.</p><p id="p0106" num="0106">In addition, the data processing device for a gas chromatograph may be one that is configured to only include: a known RI data storage part that stores a plurality of pieces of known RI data each in which an identifier specific to each of registered substances, and retention indices actually measured by gas chromatographic analysis at a plurality of different<!-- EPO <DP n="49"> --> temperatures on a registered substance indicated by the identifier are paired; and a known RI data conversion part that is configured to convert from the retention indices of the registered substance at the plurality of different temperatures to a retention index of the registered substance under a predetermined temperature condition for each of the pieces of known RI data. If so, for example, regarding an existing library of retention indices for which temperature conditions are not unified, the temperature conditions can be standardized. If there is such a library using a standardized temperature condition, in the case of performing gas chromatographic analysis, it is only necessary to perform an experiment at a standardized temperature. Also, the library may also be used to, with use of the retention index conversion method described in each of the above embodiments, convert a retention index of an unknown sample.</p><p id="p0107" num="0107">Further, regarding the known RI data conversion part, the respective configurations described in the above first, second, and third embodiment may be combined.
