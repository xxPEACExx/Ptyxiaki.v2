The top plate 2 is constituted by a heat-resistant tempered glass, for example. For example, two coil units 6 and 7 and a single heater unit 8 are arranged under the top plate 2.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">As will be described later, the coil unit 6 is provided with a plurality of heating coils. The coil unit 7 is provided with a ring-shaped heating coil of a small diameter and a ring-shaped heating coil of a large diameter. Further, the heater unit 8 is provided with a radiant heater. When a high-frequency current flows in a heating coil described above, magnetic flux is generated from the heating coil in accordance with the high-frequency current, and a pan or the like that is a cooking container placed on the top plate 2 is induction-heated by the magnetic flux. In place of the heater unit 8, a coil unit may be used that has an outer diameter smaller than that of the coil unit 7.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 3 and 4</figref>, the coil unit 6 described above includes<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> a coil base 61, a plurality of ferrite pieces 63, and a plurality of heating coils 64, 65, and 66. The coil base 61 has a disk shape and has a center support 62 positioned at the center, a plurality of beams 62a that extend radially with this center support 62 at its center, and a ring-shaped side plate 62b that is connected to each end of the beams 62a. Furthermore, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 5</figref>, each of the beams 62a has a U-shape whose cross-sectional shape opens downwards, and the ferrite pieces 63 are fitted in and fixed to the openings. In addition, the heating coils 64, 65, and 66 described later are provided in the top side surface of the coil base 61, that is, the opposite side to the ferrite pieces 63 side of the beams 62a.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The ferrite pieces 63 each serves as a magnetic path of the magnetic flux that has leaked downwards and laterally of the magnetic flux that is generated from the heating coils 64, 65, and 66. With this function, it is possible to prevent the magnetic flux from leaking from the coil unit 6, and thus prevent leaking such that no adverse effect is caused to electronic components on the circuit board provided in the operating unit 4 and to electronic components on the circuit board configured to supply high-frequency currents to the heating coils 64, 65, and 66.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The heating coil 64 of the coil unit 6 has a ring shape and is arranged so as to surround the outer circumference of the center support 62 with the center support 62 at its center. The heating coil 65 has a ring shape that has a larger diameter than the outer diameter of the heating coil 64 and is arranged so as to surround the outer circumference of the heating coil 64. Each of the heating coils 66 has a deformed-ring-shape that extends in the circumferential direction of the coil base 61. Four heating coils 66, for example, are arranged with equal spacing around the heating coil 65 in the circumferential direction.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">A deformed-ring-shaped heating coil 66 is fabricated by the following processes.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">First, a coil that is to constitute the heating coil 66 is made by winding a wire rod. Then, this coil to be the heating coil 66 is press-worked to form the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> deformed-ring-shaped heating coil 66 described above. At this point, the peripheral wall surface of the heating coil 66 is press-worked into a planar shape. In the present embodiment, in particular, the press work is performed such that the peripheral wall surface of the coil is a surface (hereinafter, referred to as a "perpendicular surface 66a") that is perpendicular against each coil mounting surface of the coil base 61.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Note that each heating coil 66 is mounted from a direction perpendicular to the corresponding coil mounting surface of the coil base 61. That is, the mounting direction of each heating coil 66 is parallel to the perpendicular surface 66a.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The above-described planar surface (perpendicular surface 66a) does not refer to a perfect planar surface. Any configuration can be employed as long as the plane connecting the outer surface of the wire rod, in which the outer surface constitutes the peripheral wall surface of the heating coil 66, is a substantially planar surface.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In a stage after this press work, stress remains (residual stress) in the coil that has been formed into a deformed-ring-shape. With the residual stress, the coil tends to restore its undeformed original shape before the press work.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The stress by which the coil tends to restore its original shape before the press work is removed by applying heat treatment to the above-described post-press-work coil. As such, the deformed-ring-shaped heating coil 66 is configured. By applying the heat treatment, recrystallization of the source material of the heating coil 66 is promoted and the residual stress is mitigated; hence, prevention of change in shape is made possible under a temperature range in actual use. Grain growth due to the recrystallization can be seen in the material of the heating coil 66 after the heat treatment.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In the course of fabricating the heating coil 66, as described above, heat treatment is carried out in order to remove the residual stress of the coil; however, if the coil is excessively heated, then there is a risk of degradation of the insulation performance and resulting in the heating coil 66 with a short life. Hence, the heat treatment is performed so as not to totally remove the residual stress. In other words, the heating coil 66 is in a state in which residual stress remains slightly therein.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Accordingly, the slightly remaining residual stress is addressed by mounting shape retaining means to the heating coil 66, as described in the following.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Here, a description is given of the shape retaining means.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Regarding the heating coils 66 described above that are configured by press work and heat treatment as above, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 5</figref>, the side(s) of each heating coil 66 is bundled and retained by a tape 71 that is shape retaining means. This configuration prevents the widening while restoring its original shape caused by the residual stress remaining in the heating coil 66, as well as retaining the perpendicular surface 66a that has been formed on the peripheral wall surface of this heating coil 66 (see <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 6</figref>).</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">As the retaining method, there exist the following methods: a method, as illustrated in (a) of the same figure, such as winding the tape 71 around a middle portion in a direction orthogonal to the longitudinal axis of the heating coil 66 in order to bundle the sides of the heating coil 66 facing each other; a method, as illustrated in (b) of the same figure, such as winding the tape 71 around each of the two ends and in the direction orthogonal to the longitudinal axis of the heating coil 66 in order to bundle the sides of the heating coil 66 facing each other; and, further, a method as illustrated in (c) of the same figure, such as winding the tape 71 around the coil on the inner side in the orthogonal direction of the heating coil 66.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">With the winding method of the tape 71 illustrated in (a) of the same figure, it is possible to prevent the widening, which is caused by the residual stress of the heating coil 66, at a single winding position.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">With the winding method of the tapes 71 illustrated in (b) of the same figure, since the heating coil 66 can be retained near each of the bends of the coil where force caused by the residual stress to restore the original shape of the coil is strong, it is possible to retain the shape of the heating coil 66 more rigidly.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Furthermore, with the winding method of the tape 71 illustrated in (c) of the same figure, it is possible to prevent the bundling of the coil from becoming frayed, which is caused by the force of the heating coil 66 that tends to restore its original shape.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The tape 71 suppresses the change in shape of the perpendicular surface 66a of the peripheral wall surface, which is caused by the residual stress occurring in the heating coil 66.
