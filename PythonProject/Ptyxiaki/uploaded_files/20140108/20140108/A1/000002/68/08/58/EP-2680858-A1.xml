autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of activated T and B cells, autoantibodies and chronic inflammation that attacks various parts of the body including the joints, skin, kidneys, CNS, cardiac tissue and blood vessels. In severe cases, antibodies are deposited in the cells (glomeruli) of the kidneys, leading to inflammation and possibly kidney failure, a condition known as lupus nephritis. </p><p id="p0007" num="0007"> Although the cause of lupus remains unknown, manifestations of the disease have been linked to genetic polymorphisms, environmental toxins and pathogens (Morel 2010; Fairhurst, Wandstrat et al. 2006). In addition, gender, hormonal influences and cytokine dysregulation have been tightly linked to the development of lupus (Aringer and Smolen 2004; Smith-Bouvier, Divekar et al. 2008). Lupus affects nine times as many women as men. It may occur at any age, but appears most often in people between the ages of 10 and 50 years. African Americans and Asians are affected more often than people from other races. </p><p id="p0008" num="0008"> There is no cure for lupus. Current treatments for lupus are aimed at controlling symptoms and are limited to toxic and immunosuppressive agents with severe side-effects such as high dose glucocorticoids and/or hydroxchloroquine. Severe disease (e.g., patients that have signs of renal involvement) require more aggressive drugs including </p><p id="p0009" num="0009">mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), azathioprine (AZA) and/or cyclophosphamide (CTX) (Bertsias and Boumpas 2008). CTX, AZA and MMF are very toxic and </p><p id="p0010" num="0010">immunosuppressive, and only 50% of treated patients enter complete remission, with relapse rates up to 30% over a 2-year period. </p><p id="p0011" num="0011"> Proteasome inhibitors have shown some potential as treatments for lupus. In recent studies, bortezomib - the only FDA approved proteasome inhibitor (marketed by Millennium Pharmaceuticals under the trade name Velcade® for multiple myeloma) -

 markedly prolonged survival of lupus prone NZB/W Fl mice as compared to vehicle, and also significantly reduced proteinuria and improved renal pathology (Neubert, Kirsten et al, 2008; Lee, S.W. and Kim, B.S., 2010). In a more limited study (6 control animals, 5 on drug), bortezomib also significantly improved survival of MRL/lpr mice (p = 0.03) (Neubert, Kirsten et al., 2008). In a case study of a woman with both multiple myeloma and lupus, bortezomib combined with prednisolone improved the patient's lupus symptoms (Frohlich, Karen et al., 2010). An impediment to using bortezomib as a treatment for lupus is that bortezomib is associated with serious side effects such as polyneuropathy, thrombocytopenia and gastrointestinal complications (Lee, S.W. and Kim, B.S., 2010; Frohlich, Karen et al, 2010). </p><p id="p0012" num="0012"> A need exists for new treatments for lupus, including lupus nephritis. </p><p id="p0013" num="0013">SUMMARY </p><p id="p0014" num="0014"> Provided are methods for treating lupus in a subject comprising the step of administering to the subject COMPOUND A. </p><p id="p0015" num="0015"><img id="imgf000003_0001" he="29" wi="73" file="imgf000003_0001.tif" img-format="tif" img-content="drawing" orientation="portrait" inline="no"/></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">COMPOUND </p><p id="p0017" num="0017"> In one embodiment, the subject is a human.

 We have found that COMPOUND A is superior to bortezomib in the treatment of lupus. This is surprising because COMPOUND A and bortezomib are both reversible boronic acid proteasome inhibitors that induce cell death through activation of the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathways (Chauhan D, Anderson K.C. 2003; Piva R, Ruggeri B, et al. 2008). Furthermore, both agents primarily target the </p><p id="p0097" num="0097">proteasome 's chymotrypsin-like catalytic activity, with minor inhibition of the caspase- like and little inhibition of the trypsin-like activities (Piva R, Ruggeri B et al. 2008; Demo SD, Kirk CJ et al. 2007). Thus, COMPOUND A and bortezomib appear to have similar mechanisms of action. In addition, the compounds have very similar chemical structures. Thus, the mechanism by which COMPOUND A provides enhanced efficacy against lupus as compared to bortezomib is unknown. </p><p id="p0098" num="0098"> The COMPOUND A used in the present invention may be administered in any suitable chemical form, including as a prodrug. Suitable prodrugs include </p><p id="p0099" num="0099">pharmaceutically acceptable ester forms of the parent compound.

As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable ester" refers to a derivative of the parent compound in which the boronic acid residue is modified by making an ester thereof. Preferably, the prodrug is a boronic ester.

Determination of the effective amount of COMPOUND A is well within the capability of those skilled in the art in light of the detailed disclosure and examples provided herein. The effective amount can vary depending on such factors as the size of the subject, the severity of the lupus disease, the frequency of administration, the bioavailability of the compound, the health and co-morbid conditions of the subject, and the quantity and nature of any concurrent treatment (e.g., glucocorticoids). For example, the effective amount of COMPOUND A for monotherapy may be a higher dose than the amount of COMPOUND A that is effective when COMPOUND A is used together in combination with other lupus therapies. Effective doses can be extrapolated from dose- response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems, and may be based on the surface area or weight of the subject. </p><p id="p0145" num="0145"> Treatment can be initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage can be increased by small increments until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached. The total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day if desired. To optimize the dosing regimen, the effectiveness of COMPOUND A can be monitored by monitoring the effect of treatment on various biomarkers in a subject undergoing treatment. Useful biomarkers include those listed in the Examples section herein (e.g., antinuclear antibodies, cytokines such as IL-12, proteinuria, serum complement, etc.). Two especially convenient biomarkers for monitoring the effectiveness of lupus treatment are proteinuria and antinuclear antibodies. An effective dose of COMPOUND A preferably alters the biomarker(s) in the desired way as compared to the biomarker level prior to treatment

In general, it is preferable to obtain the initial assessment of the biomarker(s) (e.g., proteinuria or antinuclear antibodies) from the patient prior to beginning therapy and one or more additional assessments at different time points during treatment. In such a use, a baseline determination prior to therapy is determined and then changes in biomarker(s) (e.g., proteinuria or antinuclear antibodies) are determined during the course of therapy and the dose adjusted as needed. Alternatively, two or more successive determinations can be made during treatment without the need of a pre-treatment baseline measurement. In such a use, the first assessment of biomarker(s) (e.g., proteinuria or antinuclear antibodies) should be made from the subject as a baseline level for determining whether the level is increasing or decreasing and the dose adjusted or maintained accordingly. </p><p id="p0147" num="0147"> In preferred embodiments, the subject undergoing treatment with COMPOUND A experiences a desirable change in one or more biomarkers associated with lupus disease.

All mice are individually ear tagged and are monitored throughout the entire experiment (e.g., "Group#-Cage letter-Mouse#", so "3B5" = Group 3 (G3), cage B, mouse#5). Mice are age-matched and treatment started at 6-8 weeks of age. Cheek bleeds and urine collection continues weekly throughout the experiment. Mice are individually tracked for several parameters including cytokine and ANA levels, proteinuria, body mass, lymphomegaly, general health, and mortality. All parameters are evaluated bi-monthly except mortality which is monitored daily. All groups consist of a minimum of at least 10-12 mice per group. Ex vivo experiments include flow cytometry analyses for plasma cells, serum complement C3 and ANA levels; urine protein and leukocytes, serum cytokine profiling, renal histo pathology, and determination of compound levels (pharmacokinetics (PK)) in the spleen, kidney and plasma. Mice are tracked on an individual basis. For all data, mice are grouped into populations and data graphed as mean±SEM.

 before ear marking and taking baseline measures including body weight, urine and serum collections. A total of five mice from the total population were randomly selected for baseline kidney histology evaluation. </p><p id="p0598" num="0598"> Treatments and tests for each group are as described in Fig. 20. Briefly, in Group one (Gl) COMPOUND A was administered at a dose of 3mg/kg ip once per week. In group two (G2), COMPOUND A was administered at a dose of 3 mg/kg ip twice weekly. In group three (G3), bortezomib was administered at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg ip once per week. In group four (G4), bortezomib was administered at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg ip twice weekly. Groups five and six (G5 and G6) were standard of care agents cyclophosphamide (CTX) and dexamethasone. In G5, CTX was administered in saline at 50 mg/kg, once weekly, ip. Along with MMF and Azathioprine, Cyclophosphamide is a current treatment option for patients suffering from lupus nephritis as it acts as a potent immunosuppressive agent, however, due to its severe side-effects it is used only in the most severe cases. In G6, dexamethasone was administered in saline at 1.5 mg/kg, three times per week, ip. In Group seven (G7), vehicle was provided ip with Solutol as the preservative suspended in saline and 1% DMSO. COMPOUND A and bortezomib were suspended in the vehicle solution. Treatments started on day of age, 212, some mice died shortly after treatment but all animals regardless of health status were counted against the total group size from time of dosing. Bi-monthly bleeds and urine were collected and serum and urine were frozen at -80°C until assayed. End analyses included kidney histology, splenocyte B-cell Elispots, flow cytometry for B and T cell populations, pharmacodynamic markers, serum cytokines, antibody and complement levels. All graphs shown in the relevant Figures show day-0 as being the "start of treatment" and thus represents 212 days of age. Day-98 or "end of treatment/study" represents 310 days of age for the NZM animals. All graphs show time as "day on study" with day on study starting at 212 days of age and ending at 310 days of age. </p><p id="p0599" num="0599">Body Weight and Survival </p><p id="p0600" num="0600"> NZM mice treated with COMPOUND A exhibited significantly increased body weight as compared to vehicle (9% and 10% respectively; p&lt;0.001), similar to bortezomib and standards of care (see Fig. 22 and Tables 22 and 41).

 Histopathological Analyses </p><p id="p0853" num="0853"> End-stage lupus nephritis was evaluated by histopathology and scored by a board certified pathologist for the assessment of total renal damage in diseased animals. NZM mice treated with COMPOUND A exhibited reduced incidence and severity of several renal histopathologies as compared to vehicle, including glomerular cellularity (-50% reduction), glomerulosclerosis (~53% reduction), interstitial infiltration (43-46%) reduction), tubular atrophy (55-59%) reduction), interstitial fibrosis (~55%&gt; reduction) and vasculitis (~51-55%&gt; reduction) (see Fig. 38 and Tables 38 and 41). Similar magnitudes in the reductions of the various renal histopathologies resulted from both once and twice weekly COMPOUND A treatment. Significant reductions in these renal histopathologies did not occur in this model in the bortezomib treatment group, excepting for a reduction in interstitial infiltration (44%) (see Fig. 38 and Tables 38 and 41). Both once and twice weekly administration of COMPOUND A decreased several renal pathologies below that of bortezomib, DEX- and vehicle-treated groups (glomerular cellularity, glomerular necrosis, glomerulosclerosis, interstitial infiltration, tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, vaculitis). In general, COMPOUND A treatment positively impacted renal tissue damage and inflammation greater than that of bortezomib (e.g., -45-55% decrease in score for COMPOUND A over several parameters vs. -6-14% decrease in score for bortezomib as compared to vehicle) (see Fig. 38 and Tables 38 and 41). Both renal and lung infiltrates were observed in the vehicle-treated mice (see Fig. 39). </p><p id="p0854" num="0854"> These results are important because they show that treatment of NZM mice with COMPOUND A can slow and/or prevent the development of lupus nephritis in lupus- prone mice.

COMPOUND A provided a significant decrease in five of the seven renal pathologies associated with lupus nephritis as compared to once weekly bortezomib (see Fig. 38 and Tables 38 and 41).
