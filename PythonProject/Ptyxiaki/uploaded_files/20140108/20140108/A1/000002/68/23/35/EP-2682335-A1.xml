However, overall frame noise is too much to perform zero setting and pedaling force-induced deformation occurs to the frame in its entirety; hence, signals pertaining to the resultant stress and a change therein are not always detected by the sensing component affixed to the positions. In addition, the installation of strain gauge is not compatible with the bike-frame production process. Furthermore, movable parts and components are positioned in the vicinity of the detection area, thereby rendering it difficult to perform adjustment and calibration.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US7814800B2"><text>US7814800B2</text></patcit> discloses a pedaling force measurement method. However, the method involves a rear dropout which is formed in the same way as a conventional bicycle pedaling force detection apparatus body is, that is, by flexible cutting (as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3A</figref> through FIG. 8B.) As a result, the method has drawbacks as follows: failure to preclude a pseudo-spring effect; chaotic signals fed back from a sensing device body;<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> plenty of invalid signals and echo signals; and thus deterioration of detection quality and accuracy. To create the necessary displacement that a Hall sensor can detect, the structure of the wheel-holding dropout needs to be weakened, compromising the reliability of rear wheel. These drawbacks are likely to pose safety-related problems to a cyclist.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">It should be noted that a bicycle frame body is a factor in the degree of deformation which occurs to the conventional bicycle pedaling force detection apparatus body formed by flexible cutting. Hence, the degree of deformation varies from bicycle to bicycle and is complicated by the materials from which the bicycles are made. Moreover, the direction of deformation is seldom the same as the direction of the tension of a chain, and thus it is difficult to obtain accurate applicable stress-related data.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Accordingly, it is imperative to produce an apparatus which is easy to operate and conducive to accurate measurement of a bicycle pedaling force. This is not only an important topic about improved application of conventional pedaling force detection apparatuses and promotion of cyclist safety, but also is the primary objective of the present invention.</p><heading id="h0003">Summary of the Invention</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">The present invention relates to a rear dropout structure production method for a bicycle with a pedaling force detector and relates to the rear dropout structure, <b>characterized in that</b> the rear dropout body and a strain gauge coupled thereto together enable the detection of a pedaling force and a pedaling frequency to be performed easily and accurately, and a reliable pedelec bike can be produced.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In order to achieve the above and other objectives, the present invention provides a rear dropout structure production method for a bicycle with a pedaling force detector.
