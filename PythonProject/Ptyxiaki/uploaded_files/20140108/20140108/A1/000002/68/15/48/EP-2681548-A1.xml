FIELD OF THE INVENTION </p><p id="p0003" num="0003"> This invention relates generally to an assembly for use in connecting components of ion chromatography, liquid chromatography and other analytical systems, and relates more particularly to an assembly well-suited for allowing quick connections and disconnections of components in ion chromatography and other liquid chromatography systems, including high pressure and ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography. </p><p id="p0004" num="0004"> 2. DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART </p><p id="p0005" num="0005"> Liquid chromatography (LC) and ion chromatography (IC) are well-known techniques for separating the constituent elements in a given sample. In a conventional LC system, a liquid solvent (referred to as the "mobile phase") is introduced from a reservoir and is pumped through the LC system. The mobile phase exits the pump under pressure. The mobile phase then travels via tubing to a sample injection valve. As the name suggests, the sample injection valve allows an operator to inject a sample into the LC system, where the sample will be carried along with the mobile phase. </p><p id="p0006" num="0006"> In a conventional LC system, the sample and mobile phase pass through one or more filters and often a guard column before coming to the column. A typical column usually consists of a piece of tubing which has been packed with a "packing" material. The "packing" consists of the particulate material "packed" inside the column. It usually consists of silica- or polymer- based particles, which are often chemically bonded with a chemical functionality. When the sample is carried through the column (along with the mobile phase), the various components in the sample migrate through the packing within the column at different rates (i.e., there is differential migration of the solutes). In other words, the various components in a sample will move through the column at different rates. Because of the different rates of movement, the components gradually separate as they move through the column. Differential migration is affected by factors such as the composition of the mobile phase, the composition of the stationary phase (i.e., the material with which the column is "packed"), and the temperature at 
<!-- EPO <DP n="4"/>-->
 which the separation takes place. Thus, such factors will influence the separation of the sample's various components. </p><p id="p0007" num="0007"> Once the sample (with its components now separated) leaves the column, it flows with the mobile phase past a detector. The detector detects the presence of specific molecules or compounds. Two general types of detectors are used in LC applications. One type measures a change in some overall physical property of the mobile phase and the sample (such as their refractive index). The other type measures only some property of the sample (such as the absorption of ultraviolet radiation). In essence, a typical detector in a LC system can measure and provide an output in terms of mass per unit of volume (such as grams per milliliter) or mass per unit of time (such as grams per second) of the sample's components. From such an output signal, a "chromatogram" can be provided; the chromatogram can then be used by an operator to determine the chemical components present in the sample. Additionally, LC systems may utilize mass spectrometric detection for identification and quantification of the sample, either in addition to, or as an alternative to, the conventional detectors described previously. Ion chromatography relies on the detection of ions in solution, so most metallic materials in the flow path can create interference in the detection scheme, as they create background ions. </p><p id="p0008" num="0008"> In addition to the above components, a LC system will often include filters, check valves, a guard column, or the like in order to prevent contamination of the sample or damage to the LC system. For example, an inlet solvent filter may be used to filter out particles from the solvent (or mobile phase) before it reaches the pump. A guard column is often placed before the analytical or preparative column; i.e., the primary column. The purpose of such a guard column is to "guard" the primary column by absorbing unwanted sample components that might otherwise bind irreversibly to the analytical or preparative column. </p><p id="p0009" num="0009"> In practice, various components in an LC system may be connected by an operator to perform a given task. For example, an operator will select an appropriate mobile phase and column, and then connect a supply of the selected mobile phase and a selected column to the LC system before operation. In order to be suitable for high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) applications, each connection must be able to withstand the typical operating pressures of the HPLC system. If the connection is too weak, it may leak. Because the types of solvents 
<!-- EPO <DP n="5"/>-->
 that are sometimes used as the mobile phase are often toxic and because it is often expensive to obtain and/or prepare many samples for use, any such connection failure is a serious concern. </p><p id="p0010" num="0010"> It is fairly common for an operator to disconnect a column (or other component) from a LC system and then connect a different column (or other component) in its place after one test has finished and before the next begins. Given the importance of leak-proof connections, especially in HPLC applications, the operator must take time to be sure the connection is sufficient. Replacing a column (or other component) may occur several times in a day. Moreover, the time involved in disconnecting and then connecting a column (or other component) is unproductive because the LC system is not in use and the operator is engaged in plumbing the system instead of preparing samples or other more productive activities. Hence, the replacement of a column in a conventional LC system involves a great deal of wasted time and inefficiencies. </p><p id="p0011" num="0011"> Given concerns about the need for leak-free connections, conventional connections have been made with stainless steel tubing and stainless steel end fittings. More recently, however, it has been realized that the use of stainless steel components in a LC system have potential drawbacks in situations involving biological samples, and cannot be routinely used for ion chromatography. For example, the components in a sample may attach themselves to the wall of stainless steel tubing. This presents problems because the detector's measurements (and thus the chromatogram) of a given sample may not accurately reflect the sample if some of the sample's components or ions remain in the tubing and do not pass the detector. Perhaps of even greater concern, however, is the fact that ions from the stainless steel tubing may detach from the tubing and flow past the detector, thus leading to potentially erroneous results. Hence, there is a need for "biocompatible" or "metal-free" connections through the use of a material that is chemically inert with respect to such "biological" samples and the mobile phase used with such samples, so that ions will not be released by the tubing and thus contaminate the sample. </p><p id="p0012" num="0012"> In many applications using selector/injector valves to direct fluid flows, and in particular in liquid chromatography, the volume of fluids is small. This is particularly true when liquid chromatography is being used as an analytical method as opposed to a preparative method. Such methods often use capillary columns and are generally referred to as capillary chromatography. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="6"/>-->
 In capillary chromatography, it is often desired to minimize the internal volume of the selector or injector valve. One reason for this is that a valve having a large volume will contain a relatively large volume of liquid, and when a sample is injected into the valve the sample will be diluted, decreasing the resolution and sensitivity of the analytical method. </p><p id="p0013" num="0013"> Micro-fluidic analytical processes also involve small sample sizes. As used herein, sample volumes considered to involve micro-fluidic techniques can range from as low as volumes of only several picoliters or so, up to volumes of several milliliters or so, whereas more traditional LC techniques, for example, historically often involved samples of about one microliter to about 100 milliliters in volume. Thus, the micro-fluidic techniques described herein involve volumes one or more orders of magnitude smaller in size than traditional LC techniques. Micro-fluidic techniques can also be expressed as those involving fluid flow rates of about 0.5 ml/minute or less. </p><p id="p0014" num="0014"> Most conventional HPLC systems include pumps which can generate relatively high pressures of up to around 5,000 psi to 6,000 psi or so. In many situations, an operator can obtain successful results by operating a LC system at "low" pressures of anywhere from just a few psi or so up to 1 ,000 psi or so. More often than not, however, an operator will find it desirable to operate a LC system at relatively "higher" pressures of over 1,000 psi. </p><p id="p0015" num="0015"> Another, relatively newer liquid chromatography form is Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC) in which system pressure extends upward to 1400 bar or 20,000 psi. Both HPLC and UHPLC are examples of analytical instrumentation that utilize fluid transfer at elevated pressures. For example, in U.S. Patent Publication No. US 2007/0283746 Al, published on December 13, 2007 and titled "Sample Injector System for Liquid Chromatography," an injection system is described for use with UHPLC applications, which are said to involve pressures in the range from 20,000 psi to 120,000 psi. In U.S. Patent No. 7,311,502, issued on December 25, 2007 to Gerhardt, et al, and titled "Method for Using a Hydraulic Amplifier Pump in Ultrahigh Pressure Liquid Chromatography," the use of a hydraulic amplifier is described for use in UHPLC systems involving pressures in excess of 25,000 psi. In U.S. Patent Publication No. US 2005/0269264 Al, published on December 8, 2005 and titled "Chromatography System with Gradient Storage and Method for Operating the Same," a system 
<!-- EPO <DP n="7"/>-->
 for performing UHPLC is disclosed, with UHPLC described as involving pressures above 5,000 psi (and up to 60,000 psi). Applicants hereby incorporate by reference as if fully set forth herein U.S. Patent No. 7,311,502 and US Patent Publications Nos. US 2007/0283746 Al and US 2005/0269264 Al. </p><p id="p0016" num="0016"> As noted, liquid chromatography (as well as other analytical) systems, including HPLC or UHPLC systems, typically include several components. For example, such a system may include a pump; an injection valve or autosampler for injecting the analyte; a precolumn filter to remove particulate matter in the analyte solution that might clog the column; a packed bed to retain irreversibly adsorbed chemical material; the HPLC column itself; and a detector that analyzes the carrier fluid as it leaves the column. Ion chromatography may also utilize a suppressor column to facilitate detection dynamic range. These various components may typically be connected by a miniature fluid conduit, or tubing, such as metallic or polymeric tubing (for ion chromatography), usually having an internal diameter of 0.003 to 0.040 inch. </p><p id="p0017" num="0017"> All of these various components and lengths of tubing are typically interconnected by threaded fittings. Fittings for connecting various LC system components and lengths of tubing are disclosed in prior patents, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,525,303; 5,730,943; and 6,095,572, the disclosures of which are herein all incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein. Often, a first internally threaded fitting seals to a first component with a ferrule or similar sealing device. The first fitting is threadedly connected through multiple turns by hand or by use of a wrench or wrenches to a second fitting having a corresponding external fitting, which is in turn sealed to a second component by a ferrule or other seal. Disconnecting these fittings for component replacement, maintenance, or reconfiguration often requires the use of a wrench or wrenches to unthread the fittings. Although a wrench or wrenches may be used, other tools such as pliers or other gripping and holding tools are sometimes used. In addition, the use of such approaches to connect components of an UHPLC system often results in deformation or swaging of a ferrule used to provide a leak proof seal of tubing to a fitting or component. This often means that the ferrule and tubing connection, once made, cannot be reused without a risk of introducing dead volumes into the system. In addition, such approaches may involve crushing or deformation of the inner diameter of the tubing, which may adversely affect the flow 
<!-- EPO <DP n="8"/>-->
 characteristics and the pressures of the fluid within the tubing. While hand-tightened threaded fittings eliminate the need for wrenches or other tools, these fittings typically can not stand up to the extreme pressures of HPLC or UHPLC. </p><p id="p0018" num="0018"> Another approach to provide a connection in an UHPLC system involves providing a fitting assembly that uses a combination of components, including two separate ferrules. Such an approach is considered undesirable because by requiring two places for the ferrules to provide leak proof seals, it provides two places where the fluid to be analyzed may leak, as well as where dead volumes may be provided. In addition, this approach involves the use of additional components, which can cost more and also increase the time and effect to assemble them to make a connection or disassemble them when disconnecting tubing from a component or other fitting assembly. </p><p id="p0019" num="0019"> It will be understood by those skilled in the art that, as used herein, the term "LC system" is intended in its broad sense to include all apparatus and components in a system used in connection with liquid chromatography, whether made of only a few simple components or made of numerous, sophisticated components which are computer controlled or the like. Those skilled in the art will also appreciate that an LC system is one type of an analytical instrument (AI) system. For example, gas chromatography is similar in many respects to liquid chromatography, but obviously involves a gas sample to be analyzed. Although the following discussion focuses on liquid chromatography, those skilled in the art will appreciate that much of what is said also has application to other types of AI systems and methods. </p><p id="p0020" num="0020"> Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a high pressure fitting with a self-releasing ferrule for use in a HPLC or an UHPLC system. </p><p id="p0021" num="0021"> It is another object of the present invention to provide a high pressure fitting with a self- releasing ferrule that can hold to about 10,000 pounds per square inch ("psi") or more, and be reusable about 10 times or more. </p><p id="p0022" num="0022"> It is another object of the present invention to provide a mechanism allowing an operator to quickly disconnect or connect a component of a HPLC or an UHPLC system.

A reservoir 101 contains a solvent or mobile phase 102. Tubing 103 connects the mobile phase 102 in the reservoir 101 to a pump 105. The pump 105 is connected to a sample injection valve 110 which, in turn, is connected via tubing to a first end of a guard column (not shown). The second end of the guard column (not shown) is in turn connected to the first end of a primary column 115. The second end of the primary column 115 is then connected via tubing to a detector 117. After passing through the detector 117, the mobile phase 102 and the sample injected via injection valve 110 are expended into a second reservoir 118, which contains the chemical waste 119. As noted above, the sample injection valve 110 is used to inject a sample of a material to be studied into the LC system. The mobile phase 102 flows through the tubing 103 which is used to connect the various elements of the LC system together. </p><p id="p0075" num="0075"> When the sample is injected via sample injection valve 110 in the LC system, the sample is carried by the mobile phase through the tubing into the column 115. As is well known in the 
<!-- EPO <DP n="21"/>-->
 art, the column 115 contains a packing material which acts to separate the constituent elements of the sample. After exiting the column 115, the sample (as separated via the column 115) then is carried to and enters a detector 117, which detects the presence or absence of various chemicals. The information obtained by the detector 117 can then be stored and used by an operator of the LC system to determine the constituent elements of the sample injected into the LC system. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that FIG. 1 and the foregoing discussion provide only a brief overview of a simplistic LC system that is conventional and well-known in the art, as is shown and described in U.S. Patent No. 5,472,598, issued December 5, 1995 to Schick, which is hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein. Those skilled in the art will also appreciate that while the discussion herein focuses on a LC system, other analytical systems can be used in connection with various embodiments of the invention, such as a mass spectrometry, microfiow chromatography, nanoflow chromatography, nano-scale liquid chromatography, capillary electrophoresis, or reverse-phase gradient chromatography system. </p><p id="p0076" num="0076"> Preferably, for an LC system to be biocompatible, the various components (except where otherwise noted) that may come into contact with the effluent or sample to be analyzed are made of the synthetic polymer polyetheretherketone, which is commercially available under the trademark PEEK™ from VICTREX®. The polymer PEEK has the advantage of providing a high degree of chemical inertness and therefore biocompatibility; it is chemically inert to most of the common solvents used in LC applications, such as acetone, acetonitrile, and methanol (to name a few). PEEK also can be machined by standard machining techniques to provide smooth surfaces. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that other polymers may be desirable in certain applications. </p><p id="p0077" num="0077"> Referring now to FIG. 2, a first embodiment of a fitting assembly 1 is shown. As shown in FIG. 2, the assembly 1 includes a nut 10 and a ferrule 20. Nut 10 comprises nut head 12, which is proximal to the first end 11 of the nut 10. An externally threaded portion 14 is proximal to the other or second end 13 of the nut 10. Nut 10 also comprises slot 9, which in this particular embodiment extends from the second end 13 of the nut 10 through a portion of threaded portion 14. Although only one slot is shown in the nut 10 shown in FIG. 2, nut 10 can comprise a plurality of slots, which can extend any distance through the nut 10 from the second end 13 up to 
<!-- EPO <DP n="22"/>-->
 but not including the nut head 12 of the nut 10. As shown in FIG. 2, nut 10 and ferrule 20 are preferably circular and symmetric about a center axis. Those skilled in the art will realize that a circular shape has advantages, but the outer diameters in particular of nut head 12 may have a non-circular shape if desired, such as having flat or concave surface portions, to allow an operator to more easily grip and rotate nut 10. In addition, although a plurality of splines 8 are shown on nut head 12 in FIG. 2, the number and presence of such splines are optional, as is the circular design of nut head 12. As detailed herein, the externally threaded portion 14 of the nut 10 is adapted to be removably secured to a corresponding threaded portion of a port, a fitting, or a component of an LC or other analytical instrument (AI) system (not shown). Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the externally threaded portion 14 of the nut 10 may be adapted so that it can be removably engaged with any sized port, fitting, or component of an LC or other AI system (not shown). The use of external threads on one element, such as the nut 10, versus internal threads, is a matter of selection. Those skilled in the art will therefore appreciate that the nut 10 in an alternative embodiment could have internal threads (not shown) located near a second end which could be engaged with external threads (not shown) located near the first end of an alternative embodiment of a port, fitting, or component of an LC or AI system (not shown). </p><p id="p0078" num="0078"> Still referring to FIG. 2, it can be seen that the ferrule 20 as shown has a first end 21 and a second end 22, and three relatively distinct portions. These include a first tapered portion 23, a middle non-tapered portion 24, and a second tapered portion 25. The first tapered portion 23 and second tapered portion 25 each form a truncated conical shape. As shown in FIG. 2, the first tapered portion 23 and the second tapered portion 25 each define an angle from the axis of the ferrule 20. However, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the first tapered portion 23 and second tapered portion 25 can define a different angle if desired, and can define angles that are about equal to each other, or differ from each other, depending upon the particular application. As detailed herein, the first tapered portion 23 of the ferrule 20 is adapted to be removably received in an internally tapered portion (not shown) of a passageway (not shown) through nut</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">10, and the second tapered end 25 of the ferrule 20 is adapted to be removably received in a port, fitting, or component of a LC or AI system (not shown). Also shown is this embodiment of ferrule 20 is a slot 26 extending from the first end 21 through the first tapered portion 23 and into the middle non-tapered portion 24 of the ferrule 20, although in alternate embodiments the slot 
<!-- EPO <DP n="23"/>-->
 26 can extend to a greater or lesser extent from the first end 21 of ferrule 20. Although only one slot 26 is shown in the ferrule 20 shown in FIG. 2, ferrule 20 can comprise a plurality of slots, each of which can extend any distance through the ferrule 20 from the first end 21 up to but not including the second end 22 of the ferrule 20. Additionally, ferrule lip 27 is shown at the interface of the first tapered portion 23 and middle non-tapered portion 24. </p><p id="p0080" num="0080"> In general, it is believed that the externally threaded portion 14 of the nut 10 and the shape and size of the second tapered portion 25 of the ferrule 20 should be of a shape and size so that assembled fitting assembly 1 may be easily secured to a port, fitting, or component of a LC or AI system (not shown) and may also be easily removed therefrom, in either case by rotating the nut head 12 (and thereby fitting assembly 1) relative to the port, fitting, or component. </p><p id="p0081" num="0081"> Generally, the rotational force or torque applied to connect to the nut 10, ferrule 20, and tubing extending therethrough (not shown) to a port, fitting, or component in an LC or AI system accomplishes two major tasks. First, the force of the connection of the fitting assembly 1 needs to be sufficient to provide a sealed and leak proof connection to the port, fitting, or component. In addition, the force of the connection of the fitting assembly 1 needs to be sufficient so that the tubing is securely held and is sufficient to prevent detachment due to the hydraulic force of the fluid moving through the tubing. It is believed that the latter function typically involves greater forces than the former. It is believed that the fitting assembly 1 (such as shown in FIG. 2) provides an advantage in that it allows for better connections at higher pressures without requiring higher forces to connect fitting assembly 1 , and without substantial deformation of the tubing. </p><p id="p0082" num="0082"> FIG. 3 shows the fitting assembly 1 shown in FIG. 2 upon assembly. Like features and elements in the drawings have the same numerals in the various figures. Upon assembly of fitting assembly 1 only the nut 10, a portion of the middle non-tapered portion 24, and the second tapered portion 25 of ferrule 20 are visible. Additionally, first tapered portion 23 and ferrule lip</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">27 of the ferrule 20 are not visible, as these elements are positioned within a passageway (not shown) within the nut 10. Still visible upon assembly of the fitting assembly 1 are first end 11, second end 13, nut head 12, splines 8, externally threaded portion 14, and slot 9 of the nut 10, 
<!-- EPO <DP n="24"/>-->
 and a portion of the middle non-tapered portion 24, the second tapered portion 25, and the second end 22 of the ferrule 20. </p><p id="p0084" num="0084"> Additional details of the fitting assembly 1 shown in FIG. 3 are shown in the cross-section of the fitting assembly 1 in FIG. 4. Nut 10 has a first end 11, a nut head 12, a second end 13, and an externally threaded portion 14. Passageway 15 extends through nut 10 and includes an internally tapered portion 16. The internally tapered portion 16 of the passageway 15 of the nut 10 is adapted to receive and securely hold the first tapered portion 23 of the ferrule 20 when the fitting assembly 1 is assembled. As shown in FIG. 4, a lip 19 is comprised within passageway 15 near the second end 13 of the nut 10. The externally threaded portion 14 of the nut 10 is adapted to be removably secured to a corresponding threaded portion of a port, a fitting, or a component of an LC or other analytical instrument (AI) system (not shown). Also shown in FIG. 4 is an optional internally tapered portion 17 in passageway 15 near the portion of the nut head 12 distal to the first end 11 of the nut 10. Ferrule 20 has a first end 21, a second end 22, a first tapered portion 23, a middle non-tapered portion 24, a second tapered portion 25, a slot 26, a ferrule lip 27, and a passageway 28, which extends through the ferrule 20. As detailed herein, the internally tapered portion 16 of the passageway 15 and lip 19 of the nut 10 are adapted to receive and securely hold the first tapered portion 23 and ferrule lip 27 of the ferrule 20. </p><p id="p0085" num="0085"> It will be appreciated that the nut 10 and ferrule 20 can comprise a number of different materials. For example, nut 10 and/or ferrule 20 in fitting assembly 1 can comprise a metal, such as stainless steel, or each can comprise a different material, such as a polymer. For example, the fitting assembly 1 can comprise a nut 10 comprising a polymer, such as polyetheretherketone (PEEK), and a ferrule 20 comprising stainless steel. It will be appreciated that a variety of metals and polymers may be selected for either nut 10 or ferrule 20 depending on the particular application, as that may involve a particular type of sample, a particular type of solvent, and/or a particular pressure range. In addition, the selection of materials for the tubing, such as PEEK, PEEKsil™, stainless steel, or fused silica, may lead to a selection of a particular material for nut 10 and/or ferrule 20. In addition, PEEK (or other polymers) may be used that is reinforced with carbon, carbon fibers, glass fibers, or steel fibers, or the like. Other polymer materials which 
<!-- EPO <DP n="25"/>-->
 may be used include, but are not limited to, TEFLON , TEFZEL , DELRIN , polyphenylene sulfide (PPS), polypropylene, and others, depending on the foregoing factors and perhaps others, such as cost. Those skilled in the art will further appreciate that fitting assembly 1 is shown as a fitting connection for connecting tubing to another component in an LC or other AI system, and that the other component may be any one of wide variety of components. Such components include pumps, columns, filters, guard columns, injection valves and other valves, detectors, pressure regulators, reservoirs, and other fittings, such as unions, tees, crosses, adapters, splitters, sample loops, connectors, and the like. </p><p id="p0086" num="0086"> In certain applications utilizing PEEK, the PEEK used in fabrication of the nut 10, ferrule 20, and/or tubing may be annealed according to manufacturer's recommendations. In general, the PEEK is ramped from about 70°F to between about 300°F and about 320°F over about 40 to about 60 minutes, held at about 300°F to about 320°F for about 150 to about 180 minutes, ramped from between about 300°F and about 320°F to between about 392°F and about 560°F over about 90 minutes to about 300 minutes, held between about 392°F and about 560°F for between about 240 minutes and about 2880 minutes, and ramped down to between about 70°F and about 284°F over about 360 minutes to about 600 minutes. However, the skilled artisan will readily understand that different annealing protocols may be used in other applications. </p><p id="p0087" num="0087"> In order for a fitting assembly to seal, it should generally remain in compression (relative to the conical surface of the port) throughout all environmental conditions. Therefore, in certain aspects a coating with a high coefficient of friction is applied to at least a portion of the internal bore surface of the described fitting assembly 1. The high coefficient of friction between the outer surface of the tube and the internal bore surface of the fitting connection or assembly 1 keeps the tube from extruding out of the port during pressurization, which results in dramatically increased burst pressure. In such embodiments the fitting connection or assembly is coated at the internal bore surface that contacts the tube starting at approximately 0.005 inches, about 0.0075 inches, about 0.01 inches, or about 0.02 inches from the tip. Coatings suitable for use with the presently described fitting connection or assembly include, but are not limited to, nickel, silica carbide, copper, and diamond coatings, and combinations thereof.

 Methods of using the fitting assembly 1 (such as shown in FIG. 2 and FIG. 3) are now described in further detail. An operator can first provide a nut 10 and ferrule, as well as tubing (not shown). In one approach, the operator can insert a portion of the tubing through the passageways 15 and 28 of the nut 10 and ferrule 20, respectively, in any order without assembling or otherwise connecting the nut 10 and ferrule 20. Next, the operator can insert the first tapered portion 23 of the ferrule 20 into the passageway 15 proximal the second end 13 of the nut 10, such that the first tapered portion 23 of the ferrule 20 pushes against the internal tapered portion 16 of the passageway 15 of the nut 10, and the ferrule lip 27 of the ferrule 20 is retained within the passageway 15 of the nut 10 by lip 19. The operator can then engage the externally threaded portion 14 of the nut 10 with the internally threaded portion of a port, fitting, or component of a LC or AI system (not shown). Once the externally threaded portion 14 of the nut 10 and the internally threaded portion of the port, fitting, or component of a LC or AI system begin to mate or engage, the operator then rotates the nut head 12 of the fitting assembly 1 relative to the port, fitting, or component of a LC or AI system, rotates the port, fitting, or component of a LC or AI system relative to the nut head 12 of the fitting assembly 1, or rotates both the nut head 12 of the fitting assembly 1 and the port, fitting, or component of a LC or AI system relative to each other. By so rotating the nut head 12 of the fitting assembly 1 and the port, fitting, or component of a LC or AI system relative to one another, the operator drives the ferrule 20 further into the interior passageway 15 of the nut 10. In doing so, the operator thus forces the first tapered portion 23 of the ferrule 20 against the internally tapered portion 16 of the passageway 15 of nut 10, thus engaging the ferrule lip 27 of the ferrule 20 with the lip 19 of the passageway 15 of the nut 10. In doing so, the first tapered portion 23 of the ferrule 20 is compressed and held firmly against the internally tapered portion 16 of the passageway 15 of the nut 10, thereby forming a leak proof connection. Because the first tapered portion 23 of the ferrule 20 may be deformed or compressed as it is forced against the tapered portion 16 of the passageway 15 of the nut 10, a leak proof connection may be obtained by the operator without the use of additional tools such as a wrench, pliers or the like, although tools, such as a torque wrench, may be used in certain applications. Alternatively, fitting assembly 1 can be provided to the operator pre-assembled. In one specific embodiment, when tubing having an outer diameter 
<!-- EPO <DP n="27"/>-->
 of 0.0625 inches is used, the minimum diameter of the passageway in the fitting assembly can range between about 0.065 and about 0.067 inches. </p><p id="p0088" num="0088"> To disconnect a fitting assembly 1, such as shown in FIG. 2 and FIG. 3, an operator may either rotate the fitting assembly 1 relative to the port, fitting, or component of a LC or AI system (not shown), rotate the port, fitting, or component of a LC or AI system relative to the fitting assembly 1, or rotate both the port, fitting, or component of a LC or AI system and the fitting assembly 1 relative to each other. By rotating the port, fitting, or component of a LC or AI system and/or the fitting assembly 1 relative to one another, the operator thus rotates the externally threaded portion 14 of nut 10 and the internally threaded portion of the port, fitting, or component of a LC or AI system, respectively, and thereby disengages the connection between such threaded portions. At this point, the operator can use the assembly 1 and the leak proof connection it provides, until the operator decides to remove the tubing (not shown) from the assembly 1. By selecting the direction of the threading of the externally threaded portion 14 of the nut 10 and internally threaded portion of the port, fitting, or component of a LC or AI system, respectively, the operator can turn the entire fitting assembly 1 (when connected) by turning or rotating nut 10, such that the fitting assembly 1 rotates relative to the port, fitting, or component of a LC or AI system (not shown) and disengages therefrom. Thus, the entire fitting assembly 1 is easily disconnected from the port, fitting, or component of a LC or AI system (not shown). </p><p id="p0089" num="0089"> Referring now to FIG. 5, an alternate embodiment of a fitting assembly 201 is shown.

 As depicted in FIG. 12, the first external tapered portion 323 of the ferrule 320 allows the nut 310 to be removed from the port 350 more easily, since the first external tapered portion 323 allows the contact area of the first external tapered portion 323 to slide over the internally threaded portion 351 of the port 350 during removal. It also allows force to be concentrated at the portion of the first external tapered portion 323 that is nearest to the second external tapered portion 324. Upon connection of the fitting assembly 300 to the port 350, the radial force from the contact of tapered portion 317 of the nut 310 and the second internal tapered portion 330 of the ferrule 320 forces the first external tapered portion 323 of the ferrule 320 into the first internal non-tapered wall portion 352 of the port 350. The contact of the first externally tapered portion 323 and the first internal non-tapered wall portion 352 of the port 350 keeps the ferrule 320 temporarily in contact with the first internal non-tapered wall portion 352 of the port 350 during the initial unscrewing of the fitting assembly 300 from the port 350. When the fitting assembly 300 is removed from the port 350, the contact between the tapered portion 317 of the nut 310 and the second internal tapered portion 330 of the ferrule 320 releases first, then the contact between the first external tapered portion 323 of the ferrule 320 and the first internal non- tapered wall portion 352 of the port 350 releases second. This allows the tubing 340 and the ferrule 320 to be removed from the port 350 without any locking of parts. Additionally the contact of the first external tapered portion 323 of the ferrule 320 with the first internal non- tapered wall portion 352 of the port 350 allows the angle of the tapered portion 317 of the nut 310 and the second internal tapered portion 330 of the ferrule 320 to be shallow (small included angle), which allows great mechanical advantage (low torque applied to the nut head 312 to create high normal force to the tubing 340 via tapered portion 317 of the nut 310) that keeps the tubing 340 from extruding under high pressure. </p><p id="p0106" num="0106"> Referring now to FIG. 13, an embodiment of another fitting assembly 400 of the present disclosure is shown.

As shown in FIG. 19, ferrule 520 has a first end 521, a second end 522, a first external tapered portion 523, a second external tapered portion 524, a third external tapered portion 525, a lip 526, and a passageway 527, which extends through the ferrule 520. As detailed herein, the internal portion of the ferrule 520 comprises a first internal non-tapered portion 529, a first internal tapered portion 530, a second internal tapered portion 531, and a second internal non- tapered portion 528 of the passageway 527. The lip 526 of the ferrule 520 is adapted to engage 
<!-- EPO <DP n="42"/>-->
 and securely hold the lip 516 of the nut 510. Fitting assembly 500 is engaged in port 550, which comprises internally threaded portion 551, first internal non-tapered wall portion 552, first internal tapered wall portion 553, second internal tapered portion 554, second internal non-tapered wall portion 555, and passageway 556. Tubing 540 comprising passageway 541 extends through passageway 509 of nut 510, passageway 527 of ferrule 520, and passageway 556 of port 550. </p><p id="p0122" num="0122"> As depicted in FIG. 19, the first external tapered portion 523 of the ferrule 520 allows the nut 510 to be removed from the port 550 more easily, since the first external tapered portion 523 allows the contact area of the first external tapered portion 523 to slide over the internally threaded portion 551 of the port 550 during removal. It also allows force to be concentrated at the portion of the first external tapered portion 523 that is nearest to the second external tapered portion 524. Upon connection of the fitting assembly 500 to the port 550, the radial force from the contact of tapered portion 517 of the nut 510 and the second internal tapered portion 530 of the ferrule 520 forces the first external tapered portion 523 of the ferrule 520 into the first internal non-tapered wall portion 552 of the port 550. The contact of the first externally tapered portion 523 and the first internal non-tapered wall portion 552 of the port 550 keeps the ferrule 520 temporarily in contact with the first internal non-tapered wall portion 552 of the port 550 during the initial unscrewing of the fitting assembly 500 from the port 550. When the fitting assembly 500 is removed from the port 550, the contact between the first tapered portion 517 of the nut 510 and the second internal tapered portion 531 of the ferrule 520 releases first, then the contact between the first external tapered portion 523 of the ferrule 520 and the first internal non-tapered wall portion 552 of the port 550 releases second. This allows the tubing 540 and the ferrule 520 to be removed from the port 550 without any locking of parts. Additionally the contact of the first external tapered portion 523 of the ferrule 520 with the first internal non-tapered wall portion 552 of the port 550 allows the angle of the first tapered portion 517 of the nut 510 and the second internal tapered portion 531 of the ferrule 520 to be shallow (small included angle), which allows great mechanical advantage (low torque applied to the nut head 512 to create high normal force to the tubing 540 via tapered portion 517 of the nut 510) that keeps the tubing 540 from extruding under high pressure.

 Referring now to FIG. 20, an embodiment of another fitting assembly 600 of the present disclosure is shown. As shown in FIG. 20, the assembly 600 includes a nut 610 and a ferrule 620. Nut 610 comprises a nut head 612, which is proximal to a first end 611 of the nut 610, a first external non-tapered portion 613, an externally threaded portion 614, a second external non-tapered portion 615, a lip 616, a third external non-tapered portion 617 (optional), and an external tapered portion 617', which is proximal to the other or second end 618 of the nut 610, first internal non-tapered portion 608, internal tapered portion 607, second internal non- tapered portion 606, and passageway 609 that extends through nut 610. Nut 610 also comprises slot 619, which in this particular embodiment extends from the second end 618 of the nut 610 through the external tapered portion 617', third external non-tapered portion 617 and through a portion of the lip 616. Although only one slot 619 is shown in the nut 610 shown in FIG. 20, nut 610 can comprise a plurality of slots, which can extend any distance through the nut 610 from the second end 618 up to but not including the nut head 612 of the nut 610. The slot 619 allows energy to be transferred radially into the external tapered portion 617' from the ferrule 620 and then into the tubing (not shown) very efficiently. This keeps circumferential stress in nut 610 very low in the tapered portion 617. Additionally the slot 619 keeps the nut 610 from locking onto the ferrule 620 or the tube (not shown). </p><p id="p0123" num="0123"> As shown in FIG. 20, nut 610 and ferrule 620 are preferably generally circular and symmetric about a center axis. Those skilled in the art will realize that a circular shape has advantages, but the outer diameters in particular of nut head 612 may have a non-circular shape if desired, such as having flat or concave surface portions, to allow an operator to more easily grip and rotate nut 610. Although not shown in FIG. 20, a plurality of splines can be present on nut head 612. As detailed herein, the externally threaded portion 614 of the nut 610 is adapted to be removably secured to a corresponding threaded portion of a port, a fitting, or a component of an LC or other analytical instrument (AI) system (not shown). Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the externally threaded portion 614 of the nut 610 may be adapted so that it can be removably engaged with any sized port, fitting, or component of an LC, IC or other AI system</p><p id="p0124" num="0124">(not shown). The use of external threads on one element, such as the nut 610, versus internal threads, is a matter of selection. Those skilled in the art will therefore appreciate that the nut 610 in an alternative embodiment could have internal threads (not shown) located near a second end 
<!-- EPO <DP n="44"/>-->
 which could be engaged with external threads (not shown) located near the first end of an alternative embodiment of a port, fitting, or component of an LC, IC or AI system (not shown). </p><p id="p0125" num="0125"> Still referring to FIG. 20, it can be seen that the ferrule 620 as shown has a first end 621 and a second end 622, and three relatively distinct external portions. These include an external non-tapered portion 623 (which can optionally be tapered; not shown), an external tapered portion 624 and an external non-tapered tip 625, which provides extra material to deform to create a fluidic seal upon engagement with a port (not shown). Ferrule 620 also has a lip 626, and a passageway 627, which extends through the ferrule 620. As detailed herein, the internal portion of the ferrule 620 comprises a first internal non-tapered portion 629, a first internal tapered portion 630, a second internal tapered portion 631, a third internal tapered portion 632, and a second internal non-tapered portion 628 of the passageway 627. The lip 626 of the ferrule 620 is adapted to engage and securely hold the lip 616 of the nut 610. The external tapered portion 624 forms a truncated conical shape. As shown in FIG. 20, the external tapered portion 624 defines a different angle from the axis of the ferrule 620. However, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the external tapered portion 624 can define an angle that is different from the angle shown in FIG. 20, depending upon the particular application. As detailed herein, the external tapered portion 624 and external non-tapered tip 625 of the ferrule 620 is adapted to be removably received in a port, fitting, or component of a LC, IC or AI system (not shown). </p><p id="p0126" num="0126"> In general, it is believed that the externally threaded portion 614 of the nut 610 and the shape and size of the external tapered portion 624 and external non-tapered tip 625 of the ferrule 620 should be of a shape and size so that assembled fitting assembly 600 may be easily secured to a port, fitting, or component of a LC, IC or AI system (not shown) and may also be easily removed therefrom, in either case by rotating the nut head 612 (and thereby fitting assembly 600) relative to the port, fitting, or component. </p><p id="p0127" num="0127"> Generally, the rotational force or torque applied to connect to the nut 610, ferrule 620, and tubing extending therethrough (not shown) to a port, fitting, or component in an LC, IC or AI system accomplishes two major tasks. First, the force of the connection of the fitting assembly 600 needs to be sufficient to provide a sealed and leak proof connection to the port, fitting, or component. In addition, the force of the connection of the fitting assembly 600 needs 
<!-- EPO <DP n="45"/>-->
 to be sufficient so that the tubing is securely held and is sufficient to prevent detachment due to the hydraulic force of the fluid moving through the tubing. It is believed that the latter function typically involves greater forces than the former. It is believed that the fitting assembly 600 (such as shown in FIG. 20) provides an advantage in that it allows for better connections at higher pressures without requiring higher forces to connect fitting assembly 600, and without substantial deformation of the tubing. </p><p id="p0128" num="0128"> FIG. 21 shows a cross-sectional view of the fitting assembly 600 shown in FIG. 20 upon assembly. Like features and elements in the drawings have the same numerals in the various figures. Once again the fitting assembly 600 comprises nut 610 and ferrule 620. Nut 610 comprises a nut head 612, which is proximal to a first end 611 of the nut 610, a first external non-tapered portion 613, an externally threaded portion 614, a second external non-tapered portion 615, a lip 616, a third external non-tapered portion 617 and an external tapered portion 617', which is proximal to the other or second end 618 of the nut 610, first internal non-tapered portion 608, internal tapered portion 607, second internal non-tapered portion 606, and passageway 609 that extends through nut 610. Nut 610 also comprises slot 619, which in this particular embodiment extends from the second end 618 of the nut 610 through the external tapered portion 617', third external non-tapered portion 617 and through a portion of the lip 616. As shown in FIG. 21, ferrule 620 has a first end 621, a second end 622, an external non-tapered portion 623, an external tapered portion 624, an external non-tapered tip 625, a lip 626, and a passageway 627, which extends through the ferrule 620.

<!-- EPO <DP n="47"/>-->
 As depicted in FIG. 23, the external non-tapered portion 623 of the ferrule 620 allows the nut 610 to be removed from the port 650 more easily, since the external non-tapered portion 623 allows the contact area of the external non-tapered portion 623 to slide over the internally threaded portion 651 of the port 650 during removal. It also allows force to be concentrated at the portion of the external non-tapered portion 623 that is nearest to the external tapered portion 624. Upon connection of the fitting assembly 600 to the port 650, the radial force from the contact of external tapered portion 617' of the nut 610 and the second internal tapered portion 631 of the ferrule 620 forces the external non-tapered portion 623 of the ferrule 620 into the first internal non-tapered wall portion 652 of the port 650. The contact of the externally non-tapered portion 623 of the ferrule 620 and the first internal non-tapered wall portion 652 of the port 650 keeps the ferrule 620 temporarily in contact with the first internal non-tapered wall portion 652 of the port 650 during the initial unscrewing of the fitting assembly 600 from the port 650. When the fitting assembly 600 is removed from the port 650, the contact between the external tapered portion 617' of the nut 610 and the second internal tapered portion 631 of the ferrule 620 releases first, then the contact between the external non-tapered portion 623 of the ferrule 620 and the first internal non-tapered wall portion 652 of the port 650 releases second. This allows the tubing 640 and the ferrule 620 to be removed from the port 650 without any locking of parts. Additionally the contact of the external non-tapered portion 623 of the ferrule 620 with the first internal non-tapered wall portion 652 of the port 650 allows the angle of the external tapered portion 617' of the nut 610 and the second internal tapered portion 631 of the ferrule 620 to be shallow (small included angle), which allows great mechanical advantage (low torque applied to the nut head 612 to create high normal force to the tubing 640 via external tapered portion 617' of the nut 610) that keeps the tubing 640 from extruding under high pressure. </p><p id="p0134" num="0134"> The following example is included to demonstrate preferred embodiments of the invention. It should be appreciated by those of skill in the art that the techniques disclosed in the example which follows represent techniques discovered by the inventors to function well in the practice of the invention, and thus can be considered to constitute preferred modes for its practice. However, those of skill in the art should, in light of the present disclosure, appreciate that many changes can be made in the specific embodiments which are disclosed and still obtain a like or similar result without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. The present 
<!-- EPO <DP n="48"/>-->
 invention is not to be limited in scope by the specific embodiments described herein, which are intended as single illustrations of individual aspects of the invention, and functionally equivalent methods and components are within the scope of the invention. Indeed, various modifications of the invention, in addition to those shown and described herein, will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing description. Such modifications are intended to fall within the scope of the appended claims. </p><p id="p0135" num="0135"> Performance of a fitting assembly 1 as described herein, for example as shown in FIG. 2, was tested as detailed below. In the tested fitting assembly 1, the ferrule 20 is captivated in nut 10, yet free to rotate and actuate independently. The slot 26 (or plurality of slots, as detailed below) is designed and adapted to allow the portion of the ferrule 20 proximal to the slot 26 to apply a high enough normal force over a large enough surface area to keep the tube from moving while the fitting assembly 1 is used in service {e.g., when pressure is applied to fluid in the tube once connected in a LC or other AI system), and to keep the tube from being point loaded or permanently deformed by the fingers. In other words, this portion of ferrule 20 applies a radial force on the tube without point loading (as is the case with previous fitting assembly designs), which would leave a sharp mark (an annular groove) that is sometimes visible to the naked eye, and that essentially locks the ferrule 20 and tube together placing them into a shear condition {e.g., in the same situation as if there were a threaded connection). While conventional fitting assemblies may hold the tube quite well, this condition forces the tube to only be used in the port to which it was initially connected {e.g., the port in which deformation occurred), because each port varies slightly due to manufacturing tolerances, and a previously deformed tube with a groove could easily shift out of another port if so connected because the ferrule 20 would likely be essentially guided into the pre-existing groove. This is undesirable because, among other things, such a condition likely adds dead volume to the connection and the LC or AI system. Unlike conventional fittings where such deformation is a problem, in the fitting assembly 1 of this example, there may be deformation (especially when over-tightened on multiple uses), but any such deformation is not found to be in the form of a sharp annular groove in the tube and does not prevent further use of the fitting assembly 1. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="49"/>-->
 In the presently described fitting assembly 1, the region of the ferrule 20 proximal the slot(s) 26 are designed and adapted to deflect radially with minimal force. The material and thickness of the ferrule 20, and the length and quantity of the slots 26 are designed and adapted to allow for the appropriate stiffness to enable the ferrule 20 to function as desired and described. As the internally tapered portion 16 of the nut 10 is forced over the first tapered portion of the ferrule 20 during the formation of a connection, the region of the ferrule 20 proximal the slot(s) 26 easily deflects until the tube is contacted over a relatively large surface area, without permanently deforming the ferrule 20 at the point where the ferrule 20 contacts the tube. Continued force places this portion of the ferrule 20 into compressive loading, which allows the ferrule 20 to securely grip the tube. The spring-like action of this region of the ferrule 20 also allows the ferrule 20 to provide a slight radial force on tubes within a specific outside diameter tolerance (i.e., a ferrule 20 can be placed on a tube with an outer diameter of .063 inches or .064 inches and lightly grip the tube). This design feature allows the ferrule 20 to remain on a tube without falling off, yet is still easily positioned on the tube by the hand by the operator. Loading over a relatively large area as described also keeps the inner wall of the tube from collapsing in a specific area and creating a flow restriction. Such flow restrictions may lead to turbulent flow and are considered undesirable. </p><p id="p0136" num="0136">The interface of the first tapered portion 23 of the ferrule 20 to the internally tapered portion 16 of the passageway 15 of the nut 10 is designed and adapted to allow the nut 10 to provide maximum radial force without locking the two tapered portions together. In this example, the first tapered portion 23 of the ferrule 20 is designed to be about 18° included angle and the internally tapered portion 16 of the passageway 15 of the nut 10 is designed to be about 24° included angle (about a 6° mismatch between the tapers (e.g., the tapers are mismatched so that the area at the extreme end of the first tapered portion 23 of the ferrule 20 contacts the internally tapered portion 16 of the nut 10 first). This exemplary design keeps the parts from locking, yet allows the fingers to be loaded and deflected without causing permanent deformation to the ferrule 20, nut 10, or tube that prevents re-use of the fitting assembly 1. In most of the applications of the fitting assembly 1 , no marks visible to the naked eye are made on the tube by the ferrule 20. The ferrule tapers are also designed and adapted so that the natural tendency of the tube towards backing out of the port during pressurization of the fluid in the LC 
<!-- EPO <DP n="50"/>-->
 or AI system further presses the ferrule 20 against the surface of the tube, thus increasing the normal force and therefore increasing the frictional force restraining the tube. The fitting in this example is also designed and adapted to retain the tubing in the fitting during over-pressurization and vent the pressure without having the tubing extrude entirely from the fitting to prevent harm to the operator. </p><p id="p0137" num="0137"> In testing of assemblies like those shown and described herein, good results have been obtained. In a first test, fitting assemblies similar to those shown in FIG. 2 were assembled, in which the nut 10 was made of annealed PEEK and the ferrule 20 was made of unfilled PEEK. PEEK tubing was used in the test. In the test, a calibrated torque wrench was used to measure the torque applied to the test fitting assemblies. A standard union (P-779; commercially available from IDEX Health and Science, Oak Harbor, WA) was used, as this was determined to be representative of actual use of the fitting assembly, and the burst pressure was measured. Results are shown below in Table 1. </p><p id="p0138" num="0138"> Table 1 </p><p id="p0139" num="0139"><img id="imgf000050_0001" he="106" wi="171" file="imgf000050_0001.tif" img-format="tif" img-content="table" orientation="portrait" inline="no"/><!-- EPO <DP n="51"/>-->

This can be done with the operator's finger or by lightly pressing the ferrule into a surface. </p><p id="p0142" num="0142"> In a second test, fitting assemblies similar to those shown in FIG. 5 were assembled, with the exception that the ferrule had two slots of equal length 180° opposed from each other.
