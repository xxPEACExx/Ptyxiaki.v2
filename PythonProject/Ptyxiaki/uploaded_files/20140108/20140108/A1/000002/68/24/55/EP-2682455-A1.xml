Cell tissues that can be manufactured as such cultured cells have a wide variety. An example of the cultured cells includes cardiomyocytes, and the cardiomyocytes are used for heart treatment. Cultured cardiomyocytes themselves have motions corresponding to pulsation. Therefore, in a manufacturing stage of cultured cardiomyocytes, it is necessary to perform quality evaluation of whether the motions are favorable, for example.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In performing such quality evaluation of the cultured cardiomyocytes, visual observation is, for example, performed in current situations. Further, measuring a potential by<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> piercing cultured cardiomyocytes with an electrode has been performed. However, the visual observation is significantly dependent on an observer's subjective view, and it is difficult to obtain an objective and accurate evaluation result. Further, in the case of measuring a potential, the cultured cardiomyocytes come into contact with the electrode, and thus there is a problem that the measurement is not noninvasive. In addition, information that may be quantified on the basis of the measurement of the potential is limited to a pulsation time, and the like. Furthermore, an object to be measured is limited to be placed on an electrode.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Therefore, as apast technology, aconfigurationis known in which measurement points are set in an imaged screen obtained by photographing a cardiomyocyte, the luminance of the measurement points is automatically measured, and the deformation period of the cardiomyocyte is measured from the measured values (for example, see Patent Document 1).</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">By the way, pulsation in various regions obtained by an analysis of a phase difference observation moving image of the cultured cardiomyocytes shows cooperative pulsation in a culture duration-related manner. However, the pulsation shows a fluctuation due to administration of various drugs. By detecting such a fluctuation in some way, the drug toxicity, the influence, and the like in drug development can be evaluated in advance, and this has received attention in recent years.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In the past, for example, there has been a method in which an external field potential of cells is detected by an electrode disposed on a bottom of a culture dish, and the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> pulsation behavior of the cells is captured by a membrane potential change of the cells. Also, there has been a method in which a fluorescent dye, which attaches to calcium and emits light, is put into the cells, and the calcium concentration that fluctuates according to the excitement of the cells (action potential) is detected, so that pulsation rhythm of the cells is detected and an information propagation pattern of the cells is evaluated.</p><heading id="h0003">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h0004">PATENT DOCUMENT</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP63233392A"><text>63-233392</text></patcit> (<figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>)</p><heading id="h0005">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0006">PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">However, in the case of arranging an electrode in a culture dish and detecting a change of a potential, a special culture dish is required. Also, detection of the propagation of pulsation depends on the density of the electrode disposed on the culture dish. Therefore, detection of complicated propagation patterns is difficult with the density of existing devices. Also, in the case of putting a fluorescent dye, the fluorescent dye is expensive, the work of putting the fluorescent dye is complicated and takes a time, and discoloration may be caused. Further, in these techniques, a voltage is applied to an object to be observed, and a fluorescent dye is put in. Therefore, there is a possibility of influencing the object to be observed. That is, these<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> techniques may not easily and noninvasively conduct the observation of propagation of pulsation.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The present disclosure has been made in view of the foregoing, and an objective of the present disclosure is to enable easy and noninvasive observation of propagation of pulsation.</p><heading id="h0007">SOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS</heading><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to one aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a display control apparatus including: a first display control unit configured to perform display control of a cell image with one or a plurality of images including cells;

Description will be given in the following order.

First Embodiment&gt;</heading><heading id="h0012">[Cultured Cardiomyocytes]</heading><p id="p0035" num="0035">In regenerative medicine, for example, various tissues and organs of human bodies have been treated using cultured cells that are cell tissues manufactured by culturing cells collected from living bodies. Cultured cells 1 illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1A</figref> are ones obtained by culturing and raising cardiomyocytes. Cultured cardiomyocytes that are cultured cells obtained by culturing cardiomyocytes may be used for<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> heart treatment, and the like, for example. Also, the cultured cardiomyocytes may be used for toxicity evaluation for hearts in drug development.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In a living body, the cardiomyocytes continuously pulse while repeating contraction and relaxation. Therefore, in the cultured cells 1 that are the cultured cardiomyocytes, cells in each portion move in a predetermined direction like a motion vector 2 illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1B</figref> so that the whole cells repeat contraction and relaxation. In reality, the cardiomyocytes have an autonomously pulsing portion and a portion that pulses depending on surrounding pulsation. That is, there may be a case where the cultured cells 1 do not autonomously pulse, depending on a region. In such a case, the cultured cells 1 may pulse by periodically applying a voltage thereto from an outside using an electrode. The pulsation of the cultured cells 1 subjected to pace making by the voltage application from an outside in this way is basically similar to the autonomous pulsation. That is, the case where the cultured cells 1 autonomously pulse and the case where the cultured cells 1 pulse by the voltage application are similarly observed using the present technology.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1C</figref> illustrates a situation where an observation region of the cultured cells 1 is divided into a plurality of subregions (blocks), a motion amount (motion vector) is observed for each block, and a time shift thereof is observed. For example, a graph 4-1 of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1C</figref> illustrates the time shift of the motion amount of a block 3-1, and a graph 4-2 illustrates the time shift of the motion amount of a block 3-2.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038"><!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> Graphs 5-1 to 5-3 of <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2A</figref> illustrate the time shift of a relationship between the motion amount of the cells of the block 3-1 illustrated in the graph 4-1 and the motion amount of the cells of the block 3-2 illustrated in the graph 4-2.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">In the beginning when the cells are collected from a living body, the motion amount of the cells existing in the block 3-1 and the motion amount of the cells existing in the block 3-2 have poor correlation as illustrated in the graph 5-1. However, as time passes and culturing proceeds, both sides are gradually correlated as illustrated in the graph 5-2, and as time further passes, both sides are strongly correlated as illustrated in the graph 5-3.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">That is, like the graph illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2B</figref>, a correlation coefficient of the motion amounts among a plurality of positions of the raised cultured cells 1 stably reaches a large value. That is, the cooperativity of motion of cells in each region becomes stronger. Ideally, actions of cells are mutually related, and the cultured cells 1 as a whole pulse as one living body tissues.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The raised cultured cells 1 are composed of a plurality of cells, and a signal is transmitted among the cells through a gap junction. Therefore, correlation in motion is caused among the cells, and the cultured cells 1 as a whole pulse as one living body tissues. The pulsation is propagated among the cells in such raised cultured cells 1.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Cultured cells 1j having high correlation (cooperativity), and in which the pulsation is propagated can<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> be used for evaluation of drugs. For example, a drug is administered to the cultured cells 1 and the motion before and after the administration is observed, so that the effect and the toxicity of the drug, and the like, can be evaluated from a change of the motion of the cultured cells 1.</p><heading id="h0013">[Drug Evaluation Apparatus]</heading><p id="p0043" num="0043"><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a main configuration example of a drug evaluation apparatus.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">A drug evaluation apparatus 100 illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> is an apparatus that conducts evaluation of a drug administered to cultured cardiomyocytes 110 by observing a motion of the cardiomyocytes 110. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, the drug evaluation apparatus 100 includes an imaging unit 101, an object to be evaluated image data generation/record unit 102, an evaluation index data generation unit 103, and an evaluation unit 104.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The imaging unit 101 images the cultured cardiomyocytes 110 that are an object to be observed. The imaging unit 101 may image the cultured cardiomyocytes 110 directly (without through other members), or may image the cultured cardiomyocytes 110 through other member, such as a microscope.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">Further, the cultured cardiomyocytes 110 may be fixed or may not be fixed to the imaging unit 101. Since the drug evaluation apparatus 100 detect a motion (a temporal change of position), typically, it is more favorable that the cultured cardiomyocytes 110 are fixed to the imaging unit 101.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047"><!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> The imaging unit 101 images the cultured cardiomyocytes 110 during a predetermined period. That is, the imaging unit 101 obtains a moving image of the cultured cardiomyocytes 110 as an object. The imaging unit 101 images the cultured cardiomyocytes 110 before and after the drug administration. Note that the imaging unit 101 may image the cultured cardiomyocytes 110 several times after the drug administration according to a predetermined condition, such as after a predetermined time having passed, for example.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">The imaging unit 101 supplies an image signal 111 (a moving image) of the image of the cultured cardiomyocytes 110 obtained by the imaging to the object to be evaluated image data generation/record unit 102.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">The object to be evaluated image data generation/record unit 102 generates object to be evaluated image data based on the image signal supplied from the imaging unit 101, and stores and holds the generated object to be evaluated image data in an internal recording medium, for example. The object to be evaluated image data generated here becomes moving image data generated from the image signal obtained by imaging the cultured cardiomyocytes 110, for example.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">For example, the object to be evaluated image data generation/record unit 102 may extract only frame images in a part of the period from a plurality of frame images supplied from the imaging unit 101, and may have the frame images as the object to be evaluated image data. Alternatively, for example, the object to be evaluated image data generation/record unit 102 may extract a region of a part of<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> each frame image supplied from the imaging unit 101 as a small frame image, and may have a moving image made of the small frame images as the object to be evaluated image data.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">Further, for example, the object to be evaluated image data generation/record unit 102 may apply arbitrary image processing to the frame images supplied from the imaging unit 101, and may have a result of the image processing as the object to be evaluated image data. As the image processing, enlargement, reduction, rotation, and deformation of an image, correction of luminance and color, providing sharpness, removal of noise, creation of intermediate frame image, and the like can be considered. Of course, any image processing other than the above may be employed.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">The object to be evaluated image data generation/record unit 102 supplies the stored object to be evaluated image data 112 to the evaluation index data generation unit 103 at a predetermined timing or based on a request from the evaluation index data generation unit 103.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">The evaluation index data generation unit 103 performs, in each frame image of the supplied object to be evaluated image data 112, motion detection of the object to be observed (cultured cardiomyocytes 110) for each block that is a subregion obtained by dividing all regions of an image of the object to be observed (cultured cardiomyocytes 110) into a plurality of regions.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">The evaluation index data generation unit 103 expresses the detectedmotion of each block as amotion vector, and obtains<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> the magnitude of the motion vector (motion amount) . Note that this motion amount is an absolute value, and therefore, hereinafter, the motion amount will be also referred to as a motion amount absolute value.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">The evaluation index data generation unit 103 supplies the motion amount absolute value to the evaluation unit 104 as evaluation index data 113.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">The evaluation unit 104 maps the motion amount absolute value supplied as the evaluation index data 113 into a two-dimensionalcolormap, and evaluates the drug by expressing the state of propagation of pulsation and further, by quantitatively evaluating the state thereof. The evaluation unit 104 outputs the two-dimensional color map and a quantitative evaluation result as an evaluation value 114.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">The two-dimensional color map indicates the size of a parameter at each position on a plane in color. In this case, the plane represents an observation region of the cultured cardiomyocytes 110, and the color represents the motion amount absolute value (size of the value). That is, a position of the motion amount absolute value is represented by a position on the plane, and the size of the value is represented in color. That is, a distribution of the motion amount absolute value within the observation region is indicated by a change of the color on the plane.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">Examples of such a two-dimensional color map are illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004 f0005 f0006">Figs. 4 to 6</figref>. The eight color maps illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> respectively indicate the distribution of the motion<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> amount absolute value within the observation region, and a position on the color map indicates a position within the observation region and higher color density indicates a larger motion amount absolute value. That is, a portion where the color density is high indicates that the portion is intensively pulsing (being in contraction or in relaxation). Note that the arrows on the color maps are drawn for the purpose of description, and they are not drawn on actual color maps.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">The four color maps in the left side of the eight color maps illustrate examples of states of propagation of pulsation after administration of an organic solvent (control). The organic solvent basically does not affect the pulsation of the cultured cardiomyocytes 110. An example of the organic solvent includes dimethyl sulfoxide. The four color maps respectively indicate the states of pulsation, in order from above, immediately after the administration (0 ms), after 40 ms have passed from the administration, after 80 ms have passed from the administration, and after 120 ms have passed from the administration.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">Further, the four color maps in the right side illustrate examples of states of propagation of pulsation after administration of 1-Heptanol. 1-Heptanol is known to impede a function of a gap junction that relays signal transmission among cells. The four color maps respectively indicate the states of pulsation, in order from the above, immediately after the administration (0 ms), after 80 ms have passed from the administration, after 160 ms have passed from the administration, and after 240 ms have passed from the administration.<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --></p><p id="p0061" num="0061">In the cases of the left side of the <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> (in the cases where only the organic solvent is administered), as indicated by the arrows, the pulsation (the portions where the color density is high) expands its area as time passes while being linearly propagated roughly in a direction from an upper right side to a lower left side to be away from initial positions. This indicates a state where the cap junction normally functions and the propagation smoothly proceeds.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">In contrast, in the cases of the right side of <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> (in the cases of the example where 1-Heptanol is administered), as indicated by the arrows, the pulsation (the portions where the color density is high) is linearly propagated as time passes while changing the direction to revolve. That is, the pulsation sometimes proceeds in a direction returning to the initial positions (moving backward). In addition, compared with the left side, the propagation of the pulsation requires a longer time (i.e., the speed of the propagation is slow). This indicates a state where the function of a gap junction is impeded and the propagation does not smoothly proceed.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">The color maps of <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref> compare states of propagation of pulsation between after administration of an organic solvent (control) and after administration of 18-β-Glycyrrhetinic acid. 18-β-Glycyrrhetinic acid is known to impede a gap junction, similarly to 1-Heptanol. The five color maps in the right side of <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref> respectively illustrate states of pulsation, in order from the above, immediately after the administration (0 ms), after 80 ms have passed from the administration, after 120 ms have passed after the<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> administration, after 160 ms have passed from the administration, and after 240 ms have passed from the administration.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">In the cases of the left side of <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref> (in the cases of the example where only the organic solvent is administered), as indicated by the arrows, the pulsation (the portions where the color density is high) is approximately linearly propagated to be away from the initial positions roughly in a direction from an upper side to a lower side as time passes, similarly to the cases of the left side of <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>.

Further, in the middle of the propagation, there may be a case where the propagation of the pulsation temporarily stops (the propagation of pulsation is not caused in the object to be observed region). In addition, the propagation of pulsation requires a longer time than the left side (the speed of the propagation is slow). This indicates a state where the function of a gap junction is impeded and the propagation does not smoothly proceed.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">The color maps of <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref> compare states of propagation of pulsation after administration of an organic solvent<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> (control) and after administration of DL-sotalol. DL-sotalol is known to impede a potassium channel. The six color maps in the right side of <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref> respectively indicate states of the pulsation, in order from the above, immediately after the administration (0 ms), after 40 ms have passed from the administration, after 80ms have passed from the administration, after 120 ms have passed from the administration, after 160 ms have passed from the administration, and after 200 ms have passed from the administration.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">In the cases of the left side of <figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref> (in the cases of the example where only the organic solvent is administered), as indicated by the arrows, the pulsation (the portions where the color density is high) is approximately linearly propagated to be away from original positions roughly in a direction from an upper left side to a lower right side as time passes, similarly to the cases of the left sides of <figref idrefs="f0004">Figs. 4</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0005">5</figref>.

Then, the propagation of pulsation proceeding from a lower left side to an upper right side starts. Note that, during the observation period, pulsation is not caused in a part of the observation region in the right side. That is, the pulsation is not propagated in this right side part of the region. In addition, the speed of the propagation<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> is slower than the left side.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">When DL-sotalol is administered, a relaxation process is changed due to a change of a potassium channel function that works in the relaxation process.

The evaluation unit 104 compares such states of the propagation of pulsation before and after the drug administration, for example, and can determine whether the state of the propagation of pulsation after the drug administration is normal based on the magnitude of a differential value.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">Further, the evaluation unit 104 can also determine whether the state of the propagation of pulsation after the drug administration is normal by detecting a change of the direction of the propagation or the direction (for example, a reverse direction, and the like). Further, the evaluation unit 104 can also determine whether the state of the propagation of pulsation after the drug administration is normal by determining whether the propagation speed is sufficiently fast.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">The evaluation unit 104 can output a result of such evaluation as the evaluation value 114.

Note that it is desirable that the object to be observed itself moves and a drug administered to the object to be observed can be evaluated by the evaluation of the motion.

Therefore, the change of the cell pulsation behavior can be captured in a simple, noninvasive, and less expensive manner, so that the drug toxicity, and the like can be easily and accurately evaluated. Further, it is favorable for automation.</p><p id="p0149" num="0149">Note that, there are, typically, two types of toxicity of a drug: short-term toxicity in which the influence is shown<!-- EPO <DP n="44"> --> in a short term, such as about a few seconds to a few minutes after the drug administration, and long-term toxicity in which the influence is shown after a long term has passed, such as a few hours to a few days, after the drug administration. When a fluorescence reagent or an electrode is used, the object to be observed is influenced. Therefore, itmaybe unfavorable for long-term toxicity observation. In contrast, the present technology can non invasively observe the object to be observed. Further, in the present technology, the long-term toxicity observation can be conducted in a similar method to the short-term toxicity observation. Therefore, the present technology is favorable not only for the short-term toxicity observation but also for the long-term toxicity observation.</p><p id="p0150" num="0150">Further, the present technology can conduct the short-term toxicity observation and the long-term toxicity observation in mutually similar methods. Therefore, the long-term observation, such as observation taking a few days immediately after the drug administration, can be conducted. That is, the present technology can also observe and evaluate a time-dependent change of toxicity.</p><p id="p0151" num="0151">Note that, when cultured cells that are an object to be observed grow in a dense manner, dyeing by a fluorescence reagent typically becomes difficult. However, in the present technology, the object to be observed can be noninvasively observed, and therefore, the observation and evaluation can be stably conducted irrespective of the degree of growth of the cultured cells.</p><p id="p0152" num="0152">By the way, the pulsation of the cardiomyocytes is<!-- EPO <DP n="45"> --> composed of contraction and relaxation. Typically, relaxation of the myocardium corresponds to T wave in an electrocardiogram, and corresponds to the repolarization of a myocardial cell membrane. This T wave prolongation is typically called QT prolongation as prolongation of time between Q wave and T wave, and when this symptom is displayed, a possibility of an irregular pulse is pointed out. Forexample, when taking in and out of ion to the potassium channel is impeded due to the drug administered to the cultured cardiomyocytes, such QT prolongation occurs. For example, DL-sotalol is known to impede the potassium channel. That is, when DL-sotalol is administered to the cultured cardiomyocytes, the relaxation process is changed due to a change of a potassium channel function that works in the relaxation process.</p><p id="p0153" num="0153">However, in reality, even in a case where the QT prolongation occurs, when approximately uniform QT prolongation occurs in the whole cardiomyocytes, a substantial gap of pulsation is not caused among the cells, and therefore, there may be a case where no irregular pulse occurs. In contrast, if the gap junction is impeded as described above, an irregular pulse may be caused even if the QT prolongation is not caused. In the present technology, the propagation of pulsation can be easily and noninvasively observed. Therefore, occurrence of an irregular pulse can be detected irrespective of occurrence of such QT prolongation.</p><p id="p0154" num="0154">Further, in the present technology, since the observation region can be a relatively narrow region, such as about 0. 6 sq. mm, a test can be conducted with a small number of cells and few reagents. Further, the test can be<!-- EPO <DP n="46"> --> sufficiently evaluated with a commercially available high-density culture plate (1536 well plate (1.7mm diameter/1 well) or384wellplate (3.6 mm diameter/1 well), and the present technology is favorable for initial screening in a drug development. Note that, in the present technology, the observation can be conducted in a similar method irrespective of the area of observation. Therefore, the observation area can be easily changed.</p><p id="p0155" num="0155">Further, the method of evaluating the toxicity of a drug is currently proceeding, and there is a possibility that a new way of evaluation or evaluation criteria is proposed in the future. Since the state of an object to be observed can be noninvasively observed, the present technology can be applied to more various evaluation methods or evaluation criteria.</p><p id="p0156" num="0156">Further, the present technology can be applied to any case of evaluating anything as long as it can be evaluated by observing the cultured cardiomyocytes 110. For example, it can be a gas, a liquid, or a solid. Also, it can be environmental conditions at the time of observation (for example, the temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, brightness, vibration, magnetic field, and the like).</p><p id="p0157" num="0157">Note that, since the present technology can easily observe the propagation of pulsation, the present technology can be applied to a method in which pulsation rhythm of cells is detected by putting a fluorescent dye and detecting the calcium concentration that fluctuates according to the excitement of the cells (action potential), and an information<!-- EPO <DP n="47"> --> propagation pattern of the cells is evaluated.</p><heading id="h0023">&lt;2.
