There are currently many food processors in the market today, most of them utilizing a hand knob that rotates the shaft with blades attached. The spinning blades then chop up the food. However, the structure of these food processors tends to be more complex, especially when a higher drive ratio is required, resulting in an increase in the size of the knob in the center of the cover, making it more difficult to manufacture and assemble. Furthermore, the food in said food processor encounters less resistance, leading to lower chopping efficiency. The hand turning of the knob requires more effort to operate.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Summary of the Invention</b></heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">It is an object of the present invention to provide a convenient and efficient food processor that solves the existing technical problem of inefficient and inconvenient operation of the existing food processor.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The present invention relates to a portable food processor comprising a container adapted for receiving food, a food processing member being mounted inside the said container adapted for being rotated relative to the said container and a container cover member adapted for covering the opening of the said container;

The container cover member 200' comprises the cover that closes the aperture of the container 100, the pull rod member 230 that protrudes on top of the cover, and the transmission device 250' that is arranged in the cover. The pull rod member 230' rotates the food processor member 300 relative to the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> container 100'. The spinning of the food processing member 300 relative to the container 100' allows the draining, cutting up or mixing of the food.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>, <figref idrefs="f0003">2a</figref> show, in this embodiment, the cover is assembled from the upper shell 210' and the lower shell 220'. The upper shell 210' and the lower shell 220 are securely attached together by screws or equivalent, and the cavity between the upper shell 210 and the lower shell 220' is where the transmission device 250' can then be placed. The lower shell 220' fits onto the aperture of the container 100', so that lower shell 220' covers the aperture of the container 100. The pull rod member comprises the sliding track 231' and the pull rod 233' within the sliding track 231' that is between the upper shell 210' and the lower shell 220'. The pull rod 233' fits into the sliding track 231', so that the pull rod 233' can slide back and forth on a level plane.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Preferably, a handle is mounted to an end of the pull rod 233', an elastic member adapted for allowing it to be pulled and be extended is mounted to an other end of the pull rod 233'. In this embodiment, the elastic member is a spring 233b'. An end of the spring is mounted to the convex member 233a' on the pull rod and the other end of the spring is mounted to the upper shell 210'. By using the handle to pull the pull rod 233' out of the sliding track 231', the spring 233b' will return the pull rod 233' back into the sliding track 231', so it is easy to operate.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>, the handle 236' can be of D-shape, there is a connecting rod 237' which connects the handle and the pull rod 233'. The connecting region between the connecting rod 237' and the pull rod forms a step 237a', there is sleeve connector 238' is arranged on the connecting rod 237', an end cap 239' is arranged at the end of the connecting rod 237'. There is a positioning rod 237b' arranged at the end portion of the connecting rod 237' that passes through the connecting rod 237', the sleeve connector 238', and the end cap 239'; so that the end cap 239', sleeve connector 238', and the connecting rod 237' are securely connected in position. There are sleeve apertures 236a' at both ends of the D shape handle. One side of the D shape handle is fixed in position between the step 237a' and the sleeve connector 238', and the other end is fixed in position between the sleeve connector 238 and the end cap 239, so that the D shape handle is formed by the sleeve connector 238' set between the two ends. This secures the D shape handle in position at the end of the pull rod 233', and ensures that the D handle 236' can rotate on the axis of the connecting rod 237'. When in use, the hand would hold onto<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> the D shape handle 236' to move the pull rod 233' in reciprocating movement conveniently.

There is a hexagonal shape connecting hole 255a on the top of the connecting shaft 255, the bottom of the driven shaft has a corresponding hexagonal rod 253a to the connecting aperture 255a and the top of the driven shaft has a through hole 253c, the screw passes through the through hole 253c of the driven shaft to screw into the top threaded portion of the connecting shaft 255, this mounts the driven shaft 253 and the connecting shaft 255 in place and positions one on the top and one on the bottom of the lower shell 220, and the connecting aperture 255a of the connecting shaft corresponds to the post 253a of the driven shaft thereby limiting any movement between the driven shaft 253 and the connecting shaft 255, this way it is possible to fix the clump weight on the driven shaft, the driven shaft 253 via the connecting shaft 255 rotates the food processing member. If it is required by the user, the connecting aperture 255a and the post 253a can be of a polygon or a specialized shape, as long as it can eliminate any movement between the driven shaft 253 and the connecting shaft 255. The clump weight is mounted on the same axis as the driver shaft 255, specifically, there is a hexagon shape shaft shoulder 255d at the top of the driven shaft and upper edge of the lower shell, there is a hexagon shape center aperture 254a at the center of the clump weight that corresponds to the shaft shoulder 255d, therefore the clump weights rotates in sync with the driven shaft 253, can vary the inertia when the driven shaft rotates. Similarly, as in the first embodiment, the clump weight can also be attached on the same axis at the lower part of the driven shaft.<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --></p><p id="p0050" num="0050">In the above embodiments, it is possible to install the convex element 111 (see <figref idrefs="f0015">Figure 10</figref>) on the inner surface of the container 100 as well as the along the axis line, that is the convex element 111 goes from the top of the inner wall of the container 100 along the inner wall surface towards the bottom, this convex element 111 can increase the friction between the food and the food processing member 300 when the food processing member 300 is rotating; so that the food will be chopped up more efficiently. The convex element 111 can increase to four or more. In the embodiment above, can install two concave regions 112 in the outside surface of the container 100, these two concave regions 112 evenly spaced on the surface of the container 100, to make it convenient to hold onto the container 100 when it is being used, so that the container 100 stays in place, and the user can use the other hand to activate the pull rod member 230, to operate the food processor. Furthermore, with the two concave regions, the user can switch hands to operate, leading to higher efficiency in processing the food. In this embodiment, the two concave regions 112 becomes a concave region inside the container 100, these concave region 112 in a way increases the friction to the food being processed inside the container 100. The four said convex element 111 can be divided into two groups; each group includes two of the convex elements, the convex elements of each group uses the concave region 112 as the center to space evenly apart, that is the two convex elements are evenly spaced on either side of the each concave region 112.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">The present invention has been described in detail, with reference to the preferred embodiment, in order to enable the reader to practice the invention without undue experimentation.
