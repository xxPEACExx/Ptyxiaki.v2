By using the flux, any intermetallic compounds can be formed between the solder and the metallic surface of the subject to be soldered so that they can be strongly connected.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The solder paste is a composite material that is formed by mixing the solder powder and the flux. The solder paste is applied to a portion, electrodes, terminals and the like, to be soldered of a board such as a printed circuit board by a printing method or a discharge method. Any components are mounted on the soldered portion thereof to which the solder paste is applied. The soldering is performed so that the board is heated in a heating furnace called as "reflow furnace" to fuse the solder.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Any viscosity improver called as thixotropic agent is added to the flux used in the solder paste and it is designed to suppress sedimentation of the solder powder in the flux. In<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> the past, hardened castor oil has been added as the thixotropic agent. Flux in which stearic acid amide has been added has been proposed (For example, see Patent Document 1).</p><heading id="h0003">[DOCUMENTS FOR PRIOR ART]</heading><heading id="h0004">[PATENT DOCUMENTS]</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2004025305A"><text>2004-25305</text></patcit></p><heading id="h0005">[SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION]</heading><heading id="h0006">[PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION]</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">Sedimentation of the solder powder in the flux of the solder paste in which the flux and the solder powder are mixed is because specific gravity of the solder powder is about 7.4 in relation to that the specific gravity of the flux is set to be one and their specific gravities are substantially different from each other.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Accordingly, in order to suppress sedimentation of the solder powder which have difference of specific gravity from that of the flux, any precipitate having a network structure has been formed in the flux. It has been the past thixotropic agent to allow the precipitate having such a network structure to be formed. Such a network structure has caused elasticity to be enhanced in the solder paste.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The solder paste is printed and applied to the board or the like by using a metal screen which is provided with openings each corresponding to a position and a size of an electrode or the like on the board. The solder paste is printed and applied thereto so that the solder paste is put on the metal screen and a scraping implement called as squeegee is slid on the metal screen using power of driving source such as a motor.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009"><!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> When sliding the squeegee on the metal screen, the solder paste is transferred and entered to the openings of the metal screen with it being rotated by the squeegee. When the metal screen is then removed, the solder paste filled in the openings is transferred on the board. Accordingly, the solder paste is put on a state where it is always stirred during a period of printing and applying time of the solder paste.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">When the solder paste having the elasticity by adding the thixotropic agent is stirred, a part of the network structure in the flux is destroyed, which causes viscosity thereof to be dropped in a course of the printing. When stirring the solder paste, any chemical reaction is accelerated between the flux and the solder powder. Such a chemical reaction causes the elasticity thereof to be artificially increased so that the viscosity of the solder paste significantly varies.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The past-used thixotropic agent contains hardened castor oil or lubricant of amide type. In the solder paste in which the flux to which it is added and the solder powder are mixed, the elasticity of the solder paste is enhanced so that an effect of suppressing sedimentation of solder powder is obtained and an effect of maintaining a shape of the solder paste when applying it is also obtained.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">On the other hand, based on the quality of the thixotropic agent to be added, in addition to the effect of suppressing sedimentation of solder powder, an action may also arise such that the viscosity of the solder paste varies, the printing and applying quality based on the fact that the viscosity thereof drops down when stirring the solder paste is changed and a spread thereof when heating it is changed.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Accordingly, although, taking into consideration these features, it is necessary to adjust mixture of the thixotropic agent so that sedimentation of the solder powder can be suppressed and the viscosity of the solder paste can be prevented from varying, there has been no flux<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> having both the effects of suppressing sedimentation of the solder powder and preventing the viscosity of the solder paste from varying.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The present invention has an object to provide flux which is mixed with the solder powder to produce the solder paste, the viscosity of which is prevented from varying.</p><heading id="h0007">[MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS]</heading><p id="p0015" num="0015">Inventors have paid attention to a polymer having a special quality for improving fluidity and have found out a component that does not hinder the effect of suppressing sedimentation of the solder powder by adding the thixotropic agent and controls viscosity lowering.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">This invention relates to flux which is mixed with solder powder to produce the solder paste, the flux containing an amount of methacrylate polymer which reduces a thixotropic index of the solder paste and enhances viscosity thereof.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">As the methacrylate polymer, polyalkyl methacrylate having an alkyl group is preferable and it is preferable that an addition amount of polyalkyl methacrylate is 0.5-5.0 % thereof.

In order to enhance the viscosity of the solder paste without blocking any effect of suppressing sedimentation of the solder powder by this hardened castor oil, the flux according to these embodiments contains methacrylate polymer. As the methacrylate polymer, polyalkyl methacrylate having an alkyl group is preferable.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In the solder paste in which the flux to which polyalkyl methacrylate is added and the solder powder are mixed, the viscosity of the solder paste can be enhanced. Further, the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> addition of the hardened castor oil suppresses sedimentation of the solder powder so that the solder powder and the flux are inhibited from being separated. The addition of polyalkyl methacrylate to the flux does not block any effect of suppressing sedimentation of the solder powder by the addition of the hardened castor oil.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The viscosity of the solder paste varies on the basis of an addition amount of the polyalkyl methacrylate to the flux. When increasing the addition amount of polyalkyl methacrylate, the viscosity of the solder paste is enhanced. On the other hand, there is an addition amount of polyalkyl methacrylate which decreases a rate of enhancement of the viscosity of the solder paste.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Elasticity of the solder paste varies on the basis of an addition amount of the polyalkyl methacrylate to the flux. When increasing the addition amount of polyalkyl methacrylate, the elasticity of the solder paste is decreased.
