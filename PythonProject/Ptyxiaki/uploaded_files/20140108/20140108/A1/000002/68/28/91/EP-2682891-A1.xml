Description of the Related Art:</i></b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">An electronic device may store important data such as a large capacity address book, business data, and a personal financial authentication certificate. Therefore, for security, a user sets a lock on an electronic device using a password or pattern matching. However, when a lock is set to an electronic device using a password, an unlocking speed is slow as compared to releasing the lock using pattern matching.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Also, when a lock is set using pattern matching according to the related art, security is reduced. For example, since a pattern is easily exposed to other people's eyes even when other people in the neighborhood only glances at a user releasing the lock of an electronic device using pattern matching, the particular pattern used to unlock the electronic device may be easily determined by others.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Of course, when the user sets a difficult pattern or password in order to raise security, the security is raised but the user has a difficulty in using an electronic device. When the user sets an easy pattern or password, the user has convenience in using the electronic device but the security lowers. Therefore, an unlocking method for improving security while swiftly releasing lock setting of an electronic device is required.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The above information is presented as background information only to assist with an understanding of the present disclosure.

It includes various specific details to assist in that understanding, but these are to be regarded as merely exemplary. Accordingly, those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that various changes and modifications of the embodiments described herein can be made without departing from the scope of the invention. In addition, descriptions of well-known functions and constructions may be omitted for clarity and conciseness.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The terms and words used in the following description and claims are not limited to the bibliographical meanings, but are merely used by the inventor to<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> enable a clear and consistent understanding of the invention. Accordingly, it should be apparent to those skilled in the art that the following description of exemplary embodiments of the present invention is provided for illustration purpose only and not for the purpose of limiting the invention as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">It is to be understood that the singular forms "a," "an," and "the" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to "a component surface" includes reference to one or more of such surfaces.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a view illustrating a construction of an electronic device, for releasing lock using an element combining color and symbol according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, when a user turns on power or inputs a start button, etc. of the electronic device in order to use the electronic device, a first group 101 and a second group 102 may be symmetrically displayed on a touchscreen of the electronic device.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Each of the first group 101 and the second group 102 includes at least two elements 103. The two groups 101 and 102 may be displayed on the touchscreen of the electronic device. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the two groups 101 and 102 may be symmetrically displayed on the touchscreen of the electronic device left and right, and may be symmetrically displayed on the touchscreen up and down. While the two groups 101 and 102 may be displayed on the touchscreen in the present exemplary embodiment, three or four groups may also be displayed. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the two groups may be displayed on the touchscreen of the electronic device, so that a user may select one element 103 included in the first group 101 and the second group 102 in regular sequence at least one time to release the lock of the electronic device.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The user may set a group where a drag trace starts among the two groups 101 and 102 in order to release lock of the electronic device. When the user sets a specific group as the group where the drag trace starts, the user should select one element included in the relevant group in order to release the lock of the electronic device. For example, when the user sets the first group 101 as the group where the drag trace starts, the user should select one element of the first group 101 and then select one element included in the second group 102. Similarly, when the user sets the second group 102 as the group where the drag trace starts, the user should select one element<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> of the second group 102 and then select one element included in the first group 101. It is convenient that a right-handed user sets the first group 101 arranged in the left of the touch screen of the electronic device as the group where the drag trace starts. It is convenient that a left-handed user sets the second group 102 arranged in the right of the touch screen of the electronic device as the group where the drag trace starts. However, any of the two groups 101 and 102 may be selected as the group where the drag trace starts, regardless of whether the user is right or left-handed.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">At least two elements 103 are included in each of the groups 101 and 102 and displayed. The element 103 may be defined as being identified by color, a symbol, and a combination of color and symbol. The user may set the total number of elements to select and color and symbol of each element in order to release lock of the electronic device. Each element may be discriminated by color, a symbol, and a combination of color and symbol. The user may set an element of only color, set an element of only a symbol, and set an element combining color and symbol in order to release lock of the electronic device. For example, the user may set an element of a "first color", set an element of a "first symbol", and set an element of a "first color and first symbol" in order to release lock of the electronic device. Therefore, each element may be identified by color, a symbol, and a combination of color and symbol.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The elements 103 according to exemplary embodiments of the present invention are arranged such that a combination of color and symbol does not overlap for each group 101 and 102. An element of the same color, an element of the same symbol, and an element combining the same color and the same symbol cannot exist in one group. For example, five elements 103 of "A of first color", "B of second color", "C of third color", "D of fourth color", and "E of fifth color" are arranged in the first group 101 such that colors and symbols are not the same. Also, five elements 103 of "E of first color", "D of second color", "C of third color", "B of fourth color", and "A of fifth color" are arranged in the second group 102 such that colors and symbols are not the same. This is because when at least two elements of the same color, same symbol, and the same color and symbol are arranged, the user cannot drag two elements included in one group simultaneously.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">The elements 103 may be arranged at random all the time (i.e., each time the elements 103 are displayed) with a different combination of color and symbol for each group. At least two elements displayed for each group on the touchscreen of<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> the electronic device initially are not fixed but may be differently arranged all the time. For example, even when five elements of "A of first color", "B of second color", "C of third color", "D of fourth color", and "E of fifth color" are initially arranged in regular sequence in one group, the above sequence is mixed at random when the elements are arranged afterward, so that "E of sixth color", "C of seventh color", "B of eighth color", "A of fourth color", and "B of fifth color" may be rearranged. However, an element of color, a symbol, and a combination of color and symbol set for releasing lock of the electronic device by the user is fixedly rearranged. For example, in the above example, suppose that "B of second color" and "D of fourth color" are elements set for releasing the lock of the electronic device. Colors and symbols of other elements may be mixed and rearranged at random, but combinations of "B of second color" and "D of fourth color" do not change and only a sequence in which the elements of "B of second color" and "D of fourth color" are displayed may change. Also, when the electronic device allows the user to select elements in a sequence different from the set sequence, respective elements are rearranged at random differently from the initial arrangement.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">A method for releasing lock using an element combining color and symbol according to the present invention is described below. The user should set the number of elements to select and a component of each element. The user should set the total number of elements to set and one of color, a symbol, and a combination of color and symbol among components of respective elements combining color and symbol in order to release lock setting of the electronic device. For example, when the user selects 2 as the number of elements in order to release the lock setting of the electronic device, the user should set one of color, a symbol, and a combination of color and symbol of each element in order to identify two elements. Each element may be set using only color, set using only a symbol, or set using a combination of color and symbol. A first element may be set using only first color and a second element may be set using a combination of second color and a first symbol.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">When the number of elements and each component have been set, the electronic device should select set elements by the total number of elements in regular sequence to releases lock. At least two elements 103 are included each group 101 and 102, and at least two elements 103 combining color and symbol should be selected to release lock of the electronic device. To release the lock of the electronic device, one<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> element included in each of the symmetrical two groups should be selected sequentially at least one time. When one element displayed on the touchscreen is selected an odd number of times, assuming that a drag trace starts in a first group of the two groups, the drag trace ends in the first group. For example, consider a case where elements for releasing the lock of the electronic device are set in an element sequence of "A of first color", "B of fourth color", and "E of fifth color". Under the above assumption, the electronic device may release the lock only when the drag trace is performed only in the element sequence of "A of first color", "B of fourth color", and "E of fifth color". When one element displayed on the touchscreen is selected an odd number of times, the drag trace ends in the group where the drag trace starts.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">Similarly, when one element displayed on the touchscreen is selected an even number of times, assuming that a drag trace starts in a first group of the two groups, the drag trace ends in the second group. For example, suppose a case where elements for releasing lock of the electronic device are set in an element sequence of "A of first color" and "B of fourth color". Under the above assumption, the electronic device may release the lock only when the drag trace is performed in the element sequence of "A of first color" and "B of fourth color". When one the element displayed on the touchscreen is selected an even number of times, the drag trace ends in the group symmetric with the group where the drag trace starts.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051"><figref idrefs="f0002 f0003">FIGs. 2A-2H</figref> are views illustrating setting the number of elements and configuration of an element according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0002 f0003">FIGs. 2A-2H</figref>, though not shown in <figref idrefs="f0002 f0003">FIGs. 2A-2H</figref>, to set the number of elements and configuration of each element, an application according to the present invention is executed.

Depending on cases, the entire processor unit 620 may be referred to as a processor. According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, when determining that the sequence of sequentially selected elements is the same as a set sequence, the processor unit 620 releases the lock. When one element is selected an odd number of times, the processor unit 620 determines that a drag trace starts in a first group of the two groups, and ends in the first group. When one element is selected an even number of times, the processor unit 620 determines that a drag trace starts in the first group of the two<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> groups and ends in a second group of the two groups. At least two elements are included in each group, and at least two elements combining color and symbol should be selected for releasing the lock of the electronic device. One element included in each of the two symmetric groups should be sequentially selected at least one time for releasing the lock of the electronic device. Assuming that a drag trace starts in the first group of the two groups when one element displayed on the touchscreen is selected an odd number of times, the drag trace ends in the first group. For example, suppose a case where elements for releasing the lock of the electronic device are set in a sequence of elements of "A of first color", "B of fourth color", and "E of fifth color". Under the above supposition, the electronic device may release the lock only when a drag trace is performed in a sequence of elements of "A of first color", "B of fourth color", and "E of fifth color".

Under the above supposition, the electronic device may release the lock only when a drag trace is performed in a sequence of elements of "A of first color" and "B of fourth color".

When determining that the sequence of the selected at least two elements is not the same as the set sequence, the processor unit 620 rearranges at least two elements included in each group at random. When the user erroneously inputs elements for releasing the lock setting, the electronic device rearranges the elements that were arranged in each group previously. The electronic device combines set symbols and set colors again and arranges them again on the touchscreen. Therefore, even when a third party sees the shape of a drag trace input by a user by accident, since the elements are rearranged on the touchscreen of the electronic device, there is no problem in security.
