These communications may be transmitted and received in the form of Radio Frequency (RF) signals from one or more antennas associated with the electronic devices. In order to ensure connectivity for communications, the RF signals need to be transmitted and received at appropriate power output levels. Otherwise, the electronic devices may suffer from dropped calls, reduced data throughput, and loss in data connection.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Wireless network carriers operating cellular networks sometimes provide specifications for the power output of RF signals and minimum receive sensitivity to these RF signals by the electronic devices. More particularly, wireless network carriers sometimes provide specifications for the requisite power output and minimum sensitivity to the RF signals by the electronic devices at various operating states of the electronic devices (for example, free space operation, head operation, and head and hand operation). Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are required to design electronic devices to meet the requisite specifications for power output of the associated RF signals and minimum receive sensitivity to these RF signals in these various operating states.</p><heading id="h0003"><b><u>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</u></b></heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">Reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings which show an embodiment of the present application, and in which:<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example electronic device in accordance with example embodiments of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p0006" num="0006"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example wireless communication subsystem of the example electronic device of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> in accordance with example embodiments of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is a front view of an example smartphone in accordance with example embodiments of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref> is a rear view of the example smartphone of <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>;</p><p id="p0009" num="0009"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5</figref> is a flowchart illustrating an example method of detecting a hand in proximity to the electronic device in accordance with example embodiments of the present disclosure; and</p><p id="p0010" num="0010"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 6</figref> is a flowchart illustrating another example method of detecting a hand in proximity to the electronic device in accordance with example embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Like reference numerals are used in the drawings to denote like elements and features.</p><heading id="h0004"><b><u>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS</u></b></heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">In one aspect, the present application describes a method for detecting a hand in proximity to an electronic device.

In the example embodiment illustrated, the electronic device 201 is a mobile communication device. That is, the electronic device 201 is configured to communicate with other electronic devices, servers and/or systems (<i>i.e.</i> it is a "communication" device) and the electronic device 201 is portable and may be easily moved between different physical locations (<i>i.e.</i> it is a "mobile" device). However, in other example embodiments, the electronic device 201 may not be portable (<i>i.e.</i> may not be a "mobile" device) and/or may not be configured to communicate with other systems (<i>i.e.</i> may not be a "communication" device).</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Depending on the functionality provided by the electronic device 201, in various example embodiments the electronic device 201 may be a multiple-mode communication device configured for both data and voice communication, a mobile<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> telephone such as a smartphone, a wearable computer such as a watch, a tablet computer such as a slate computer, a personal digital assistant (PDA), or a computer system. The electronic device 201 may take other forms apart from those specifically listed above. The electronic device 201 may also, in various example embodiments, be referred to as a mobile communications device, a communication device, a mobile device, an electronic device and, in some cases, as a device.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The electronic device 201 includes a controller including at least one processor 240 (such as a microprocessor) which controls the overall operation of the electronic device 201. The processor 240 interacts with device subsystems such as a wireless communication subsystem 211 for exchanging radio frequency signals with a wireless network 101 to perform communication functions. The processor 240 may be communicably coupled with additional device subsystems including one or more output interfaces 205 (such as a display 204 and/or a speaker 256), one or more input interfaces 206 (such as a microphone 258, a keyboard (not shown), control buttons (not shown), a touch-sensitive overlay (not shown) associated with a touchscreen display, a camera (not shown) and/or other input interfaces 206), memory (such as flash memory 244, random access memory (RAM) 246, read only memory (ROM) 248, etc.), auxiliary input/output (I/O) subsystems 250, a data port 252 (which may be a serial data port, such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB) data port), a short-range communication subsystem 262 and other device subsystems generally designated as 264. Some of the subsystems shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> perform communication-related functions, whereas other subsystems may provide "resident" or on-device functions.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In at least some example embodiments, the electronic device 201 may include a touchscreen display which acts as both an input interface 206 (<i>i.e.</i> touch-sensitive overlay) and an output interface 205 (<i>i.e.</i> display 204). The touchscreen display may be constructed using a touch-sensitive input surface which is connected to an electronic controller and which overlays the display 204. The touch-sensitive overlay and the electronic controller provide a touch-sensitive input interface 206 and the processor 240 interacts with the touch-sensitive overlay via the electronic controller.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The particular design of the wireless communication subsystem 211 depends on the wireless network 101 in which the electronic device 201 is intended to operate. The wireless network 101 may include one or more of a Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN) and/or a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) and/or other suitable network arrangements. In some example embodiments, the electronic device 201 is configured to communicate over both the WWAN and WLAN, and to roam between these networks. The electronic device 201 may send and receive communication signals over the wireless network 101 via the wireless communication subsystem 211 after the required network registration or activation procedures have been completed. Greater details of an example wireless communication subsystem 211 of the electronic device 201 are provided below with reference to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In at least some example embodiments, the auxiliary input/output (I/O) subsystems 250 may include an external communication link or interface; for example, an Ethernet connection. The electronic device 201 may include other wireless communication interfaces for communicating with other types of wireless networks 101; for example, a wireless network 101 such as an orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM) network. The auxiliary I/O subsystems 250 may include a vibrator for providing vibratory notifications in response to various events on the electronic device 201 such as receipt of an electronic communication or incoming phone call, or for other purposes such as haptic feedback (<i>i.e.</i> touch feedback).</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In at least some example embodiments, the electronic device 201 may provide for communications between the electronic device 201 and other devices, tags or systems over the Near Field Communications (NFC) protocol. The NFC protocol is a set of standards that allow electronic devices 201 to wirelessly communicate with other devices and tags when they are in close proximity. The NFC protocol typically operates within the frequency band of 13.56 MHz and has a working distance of 4 cm or less. There are three data rates of transfer within the NFC protocol: 106 kilobits per second (kbit/s), 212 kbit/s and 424 kbit/s. There are two modes of communications supported by the NFC protocol: passive communication mode and active communication mode. In the passive communication mode, for example, one electronic device 201 provides an electro-magnetic carrier field and the other electronic device 201 answers by<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> modulating the electro-magnetic carrier field. In the active communication mode, for example, both electronic devices 201 communicate with each other by alternatively generating their own electro-magnetic carrier fields.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The electronic device 201 includes an NFC subsystem 270 configured to communicate using the NFC protocol. The NFC subsystem 270 includes an NFC antenna 274 coupled to an NFC integrated circuit (IC) 272. The NFC IC 272 is a dedicated controller which controls the operation of the NFC antenna 274, and is communicably coupled to the processor 240. In one example, the NFC antenna 274 may be an inductor (<i>i.e.</i> a wired coil) that provides an electro-magnetic carrier field for communications over the NFC protocol. The NFC IC 272 may generate an alternating current at 13.56 MHZ through the NFC antenna 274 which induces the electro-magnetic carrier field for communications within other electronic devices 201 equipped with NFC interfaces.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">As the NFC antenna 274 has a specific load, voltage is also induced within the NFC antenna 274 when an electro-magnetic carrier field is generated. Accordingly, the NFC antenna 274 produces a particular induced voltage due to the load of the NFC antenna 274. A load condition within the electro-magnetic field may vary if there is the presence of an additional load. For example, during the NFC protocol communication process, the presence of another electronic device 201 within the vicinity of the electro-magnetic carrier field may increase the load condition, and in turn the induced voltage within the NFC antenna 274. Additionally, the presence of a hand (such as a user holding the electronic device 201) or a flat surface (on which the electronic device 201 may rest) that is within the vicinity of the electro-magnetic carrier field may also increase the load condition, and in turn the induced voltage within the NFC antenna 274.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The functions and features of the NFC subsystem 270 may be used for other purposes beyond wireless communications such as for detection and power adjusting purposes. For example, in at least some example embodiments, the electronic device 201, or more particularly one or more modules or software applications within the electronic device 201, may monitor the induced voltage within the NFC antenna 274,<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> and determine that a hand is in proximity to the electronic device 201 based on a change in the induced voltage that is caused by a change in the load condition within the electro-magnetic carrier field generated by the NFC antenna 274 due to the presence of the hand. Based on the detection of the hand, the electronic device 201 may in turn adjust the power output of a mobile antenna (which may be referred to as the total radiated power (TRP)) associated with the electronic device 201 (for example, in the wireless communication subsystem 211) and/or may adjust the total isotropic sensitivity (TIS) associated with the mobile antenna.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In one example, the NFC antenna 274 may be located near a rear side of the electronic device 201. For example, the NFC antenna 274 may be located underneath the housing on a rear side of the electronic device 201. That is, the NFC antenna 274 may be situated between the rear side housing cover and most of the device components of the electronic device 201. Accordingly, changes in load conditions within the NFC antenna 274 may occur when a load such as a hand of a user is placed at or near the rear side of the electronic device 201.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The front side of the electronic device 201 is typically the side on which the display 204 is mounted. In contrast, the rear side is typically a side which does not include the main display 204 of the electronic device 201. The rear side, in at least some embodiments, is the side of the electronic device 201 which is opposite the side which includes the display 204.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The short-range communication subsystem 262 is an additional optional component which provides for communication between the electronic device 201 and different systems or devices, which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example, the short-range communication subsystem 262 may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components, or a wireless bus protocol compliant communication mechanism such as a Bluetooth<sup>®</sup> communication module to provide for communication with similarly-enabled systems and devices.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In at least some example embodiments, the electronic device 201 also includes a removable memory module 230 (which may be flash memory, such as a<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> removable memory card) and a memory interface 232. Network access may be associated with a subscriber or user of the electronic device 201 via the memory module 230, which may be a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card for use in a GSM network or other type of memory card for use in the relevant wireless network type. The memory module 230 is inserted in or connected to the memory interface 232 of the electronic device 201 in order to operate in conjunction with the wireless network 101.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The data port 252 may be used for synchronization with a user's host computer system (not shown). The data port 252 enables a user to set preferences through an external device or software application and extends the capabilities of the electronic device 201 by providing for information or software downloads to the electronic device 201 other than through the wireless network 101. The alternate download path may for example, be used to load an encryption key onto the electronic device 201 through a direct, reliable and trusted connection to thereby provide secure device communication.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In at least some example embodiments, the electronic device 201 is provided with a service routing application programming interface (API) which provides an application with the ability to route traffic through a serial data (i.e., USB) or Bluetooth<sup>®</sup> (Bluetooth<sup>®</sup> is a registered trademark of Bluetooth SIG, Inc.) connection to a host computer system using standard connectivity protocols. When a user connects their electronic device 201 to the host computer system via a USB cable or Bluetooth<sup>®</sup> connection, traffic that was destined for the wireless network 101 is automatically routed to the electronic device 201 using the USB cable or Bluetooth<sup>®</sup> connection.

For example, the electronic device 201 may include an orientation sensor 280 that detects the orientation of the electronic device 201 or that generates information from which the orientation of the electronic device 201 can be determined, such as acceleration information. In some example embodiments, the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> orientation sensor 280 is an accelerometer, such as a three-axis accelerometer. An accelerometer is a sensor which converts acceleration from motion (e.g. movement of the electronic device 201 or a portion thereof due to the strike force) and gravity which are detected by a sensing element into an electrical signal (producing a corresponding change in output). Accelerometers may be available in one, two or three axis configurations. Higher order axis configurations are also possible. Accelerometers may produce digital or analog output signals depending on the type of accelerometer. In other example embodiments, the orientation sensor 280 may be of other forms instead of or in addition to an accelerometer. For example, the orientation sensor 280 may be a gravity sensor, a gyroscope, a tilt sensor, an electronic compass or other suitable sensors, or combinations thereof.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The orientation sensor 280 may generate orientation data which specifies the orientation of the electronic device 201. The orientation data, in at least some example embodiments, specifies the orientation of the electronic device 201 relative to the gravitational field of the earth. Accordingly, in at least some example embodiments, the orientation data may be used when determining whether a hand of a user is in proximity to the electronic device 201 in addition to a change in the induced voltage within the NFC antenna 274. For example, in at least some example embodiments, orientation data that indicates that the electronic device 201 is in a table-top orientation (that is, the electronic device 201 is lying flat on its rear-side on a surface (such as a floor, ground, table, etc.)) may be used to determine that a hand is not in proximity to the electronic device 201 as a change in load condition within the NFC antenna may be caused by the surface and not the hand.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The electronic device 201 may also include an infrared (IR) sensor 282. The infrared sensor 282 may sense objects within the proximity of the electronic device 201 by measuring infrared light (<i>i.e.</i> light outside the visible spectrum) reflecting from objects within a field of view. More particularly, the infrared sensor emits infrared light and detects reflected infrared light. For example, the infrared sensor 282 may include one or more infrared emitting devices such as a diode. The diodes are configured to emit infrared light from a side of the electronic device 201 (such as at or near a front side of the electronic device 201). When light is emitted by the diodes, the light may be<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> reflected by an object (such as a head of a user) which is located within the sensing area (<i>i.e.</i> the side of the electronic device 201 from which the infrared light is emitted). The reflected infrared light is then received by the infrared sensor 282. For example, the infrared sensor 282 may include one or more infrared receiving devices such as a photodiodes. The photodiodes produce electrical signals which depend on the amount of light which was output from the diodes and which was reflected by an object and received at the photodiodes. Accordingly, different objects may be sensed and classified by the infrared sensor 282.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In at least some example embodiments, the infrared sensor may be used to detect a head of a user of the electronic device 201. For example, a head of a user which is within the sensing area of the infrared sensor 282, may reflect infrared light that is emitted from the infrared sensor 282. The reflected infrared light may then be received by the infrared sensor 282. The infrared sensor 282 may then determine the object to be the head of a user based on the level of infrared light emitted and received. For example, if the amount of infrared light received exceeds a threshold, then the electronic device 201 may determine that a head may be present. That is, the electronic device 201 may then determine that a head of a user is in proximity to the electronic device 201.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">It will be appreciated that the electronic device 201 may include other sensors not specifically described herein.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The electronic device 201 also includes or is connectable to a power source such as a battery 238.

In one such example, the detection module 226 may be configured to perform some of these detection features and functionalities by interfacing with various components such as the NFC subsystem 270 and/or the sensors (such as the infrared sensor 282 and/or the orientation sensor 280). For example, in at least some example embodiments, the detection module 226, may monitor an induced voltage at the NFC antenna 274, and determine whether a hand is in proximity to the electronic device 201 based on the induced voltage. For example, the detection module 226 may interface with the NFC IC 272 to examine induced voltage fluctuations within the NFC antenna 274 due to load condition changes. If the induced voltage fluctuation is above a pre-determined threshold that may correlate to the load of a hand, the detection module 226 may determine that a hand is in proximity of the electronic device 201. For example, as the NFC antenna 274 is located near a rear side of the electronic device 201, the detection module 226 may determine the presence of a hand when a user conventionally holds the electronic device 201 for operation (<i>i.e.</i> holding the electronic device 201 from a rear side).</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">In at least some example embodiments, the detection module 226 may also interface with the infrared sensor 282 and/or the orientation sensor 280 for detection purposes.

The detection module 226 may be configured to interface with the infrared sensor 282 to receive a<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> reflection of infrared light emitted by the infrared sensor 282, and determine whether a head is in proximity to the electronic device 201 based on the reflection. That is, the detection module 226 determines whether a head of a user is in the vicinity of the electronic device 201 by analyzing the reflected light received by the infrared sensor 282. For example, as the infrared sensor 282 may be located on a front side of the electronic device 201 (and accordingly emits infrared light from a front side), the detection module 226 may determine the presence of a head when a user is conventionally operating the electronic device 201 for voice communication (<i>i.e.</i> holding the electronic device 201 close to an ear).

Accordingly, the orientation of the electronic device 201 may be a factor in determining whether a hand of a user is near the electronic device 201 (and/or when determining whether a head is near the electronic device 201). For example, if the orientation of the electronic device 201 is a table-top orientation, the electronic device 201 may conclude that the presence of a load condition detected by a change in voltage at an NFC subsystem 270 is caused by the presence of an object that is not a hand; for example, it is caused by a table. In at least some embodiments, the electronic device 201 may determine if the electronic device 201 is in a top-up tabletop orientation in which the rear side of the electronic device is resting on a table and, if so, may determine that any change in voltage at the NFC subsystem 270 is caused by the table and not a hand (i.e. the electronic device 201 may determine that a hand is not present).<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --></p><p id="p0049" num="0049">After the detection module 226 performs the detection operations, the power adjuster module 228 may be configured to adjust the power output of the mobile antenna associated with electronic device 201 and/or to adjust the total isotropic sensitivity (TIS) associated with the mobile antenna.

The created induced voltage within the NFC antenna 274 may be represented by the following equation which is based on the principles of Ohm's Law: <maths id="math0001" num=""><math display="block"><mi mathvariant="normal">V</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>I x Z</mi></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="36" he="12" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths><br/>
where I is the current supplied by, for example, the NFC IC 272, Z is the impedance (<i>i.e.</i> the complex generalization of resistance) of the NFC antenna, and V is the voltage induced within the NFC antenna 274.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">The electronic device 201 monitors the induced voltage created within the NFC antenna 274. In at least some example embodiments, the electronic device 201<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> may interface with the NFC IC 272 to monitor the induced voltage at the NFC antenna 274. For example, the electronic device 201 may query the NFC IC 272 for the induced voltage at the NFC antenna 274, and the NFC IC 272 may report the induced voltage. In other example embodiments, the NFC IC 272 may inform the electronic device 201 of the induced voltage at the NFC antenna 274.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">The electronic device 201 then, at 504, determines whether a hand is in proximity to the electronic device 201 based on the induced voltage. For example, the electronic device 201 may determine whether a change in the induced voltage at the NFC antenna 274 correlates to the load of a hand.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">As the NFC antenna 274 generates an electro-magnetic carrier field, a change in the load condition within the electro-magnetic carrier field varies the induced voltage at the NFC antenna 274.

if the current I supplied by, for example the NFC IC 272, is constant, and the impedance Z increases to Z' due to for example, an additional load, the induced voltage also increases from V to V'.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">The presence of a load in proximity to the NFC antenna 274 increases the induced voltage at the NFC antenna 274. However, the induced voltage at the NFC antenna 274 may constantly fluctuate based on objects being near the electronic device 201 that may be located within the electro-magnetic carrier field and vary the induced voltage at the NFC antenna 274. Accordingly, the electronic device 201, in determining whether a hand is near the electronic device 201, may detect that a variation in the induced voltage is above a pre-determined threshold that relates to the load of a typical hand. For example, the difference between V' and V should be above a specified voltage value in order for the electronic device 201 to determine that a hand is in proximity to the electronic device 201. That is: <maths id="math0003" num=""><math display="block"><mi mathvariant="normal">ΔV</mi><mo>=</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">Vʹ</mi><mo>-</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">V</mi><mo>&gt;</mo><mi>Vth</mi></math><img id="ib0003" file="imgb0003.tif" wi="40" he="15" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths><!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> where Δ V is the difference between the induced voltage when an additional load is present and the induced voltage when no additional load is present (<i>i.e.</i> the load of the NFC antenna 274), and Vth is the pre-determined threshold voltage that Δ V should be greater than in order for the electronic device 201 to detect the presence of a hand. If the difference between V' and V is below the specified voltage value, the electronic device 201 may determine that a hand is not in proximity to the electronic device 201.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">In at least some example embodiments, when performing the determination process, the electronic device 201 may retrieve the pre-determined threshold value from the memory 244 of the electronic device 201. The electronic device 201 may then compare the change in the induced voltage to the pre-determined threshold value in order to determine whether the change in the induced voltage is caused by the load of a hand.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">In at least some example embodiments, the electronic device 201 may not analyze the variation in the induced voltage, but rather, may determine if the induced voltage at the NFC antenna 274 is above a pre-determined threshold voltage. That is, the electronic device 201 may determine the presence of a hand if the induced voltage is above a pre-determined threshold voltage. More specifically: <maths id="math0004" num=""><math display="block"><mi mathvariant="normal">Vʹ</mi><mo>&gt;</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">Vthʹ</mi></math><img id="ib0004" file="imgb0004.tif" wi="30" he="12" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths><br/>
where Vth' is another pre-determined threshold voltage that represents a voltage value that the induced voltage when an additional load is present (<i>i.e.</i> V') should be greater than in order for the electronic device 201 to detect the present of hand. Accordingly, the difference between the induced voltages at the NFC antenna 274 prior to and after the presence of a load may not be calculated, and the induced voltage at the NFC antenna 274 after the load is present may only be considered during the determination process.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">In at least some example embodiments, the NFC antenna 274 is located near a rear side 104 of the electronic device 201. In such example embodiments, the electro-magnetic carrier field generated by the NFC antenna 274 is propagated surrounding the rear side 104 of the electronic device 201. Accordingly, a load such as<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> a hand is within the electromagnetic-carrier field when placed at or near a rear side 104 of the electronic device 201. For example, a hand of a user holding the electronic device 201 from the rear side 104 may be detected.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">In at least some embodiments, whether a hand is detected or not, at 506 the electronic device 201 may receive a reflection of infrared light emitted by an infrared sensor 282 associated with the electronic device 201. For example, an object within the path of the emitted infrared light may be reflected to a sensing area of the infrared sensor 282. The reflected infrared light is then received by the electronic device 201 from the infrared sensor 282.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">The electronic device 201 may then, at 508, determine whether a head is in proximity to the electronic device 201 based on the received reflection. For example, the electronic device 201 may analyze the received reflected infrared light and the emitted infrared light to determine whether the object reflecting the infrared light is a head of a user of the electronic device 201. For example, the electronic device 201 may analyze the level and intensity of the reflected infrared light and the emitted infrared light when performing the determination process. Based on the analysis, the electronic device 201 may determine whether the electronic device 201 is likely in proximity to a head.</p><p id="p0084" num="0084">In at least some example embodiments, the infrared sensor 282 is located at or near a front side 102 of the electronic device 201. Accordingly, the infrared light is emitted around the front side 102 of the electronic device 201, and infrared light is reflected from objects within the vicinity of the front side 102 of the electronic device 201. For example, a head of a user operating the electronic device 201 by placing the head near the front side 102 of the electronic device 201 may reflect the emitted infrared light to the electronic device 201 via the infrared sensor 282.</p><p id="p0085" num="0085">After the determination processes of 504 and 508, the electronic device 201 may adjust the power output (and/or the total isotropic sensitivity) of the mobile antenna 220 associated with the electronic device 201 based on the determination results of 504 and 508. More particularly, the power or sensitivity may be adjusted at<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> 510 based on the operating environment of the electronic device 201. That is, the power of the RF signals transmitted by the mobile antenna 220 is accordingly adjusted.</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">For example, in at least some example embodiments, if it is determined that a hand and a head are in proximity to the electronic device 201, the electronic device 201 may adjust the power output of the mobile antenna 220 to a first power output state (and the sensitivity of the mobile antenna 220 may be adjusted to a first sensitivity state). In some example embodiments, if it is determined that only the head and not the hand is in proximity to the electronic device 201, the electronic device 201 may adjust the power output of the mobile antenna 220 to a second power output state (and the sensitivity of the mobile antenna 220 may be adjusted to a second sensitivity state). In some example embodiments, if it is determined that the head and the hand are not in proximity to the electronic device 201, the electronic device 201 may adjust the power output of the mobile antenna 220 to a third power output state (and the sensitivity of the mobile antenna 220 may be adjusted to a third sensitivity state). In some example embodiments, if it is determined that only the hand and not the head is in proximity to the electronic device 201, the electronic device 201 may adjust the power output of the mobile antenna to a fourth power output state (and the sensitivity of the mobile antenna 220 may be adjusted to a fourth sensitivity state). Accordingly, in some example embodiments, the power output of the mobile antenna 220 may be adjusted to one of four power output states and the sensitivity may be adjusted to one of four sensitivity output states. In at least some example embodiments, the level of power of the different output states and the sensitivity may depend upon specifications provided by one or more wireless network carriers operating the wireless network 101 in which the RF signals are transmitted.</p><p id="p0087" num="0087">The electronic device 201 may adjust the power output and/or the sensitivity by tuning one or more tunable capacitors. That is, the one or more tunable capacitors may vary the capacitance to accordingly adjust the power output, for example, to the first power output state, to the second power output state, to the third power state or to the fourth power output state. In at least some example embodiments, the one or more tunable capacitors may be tuned to impedance match the power amplifier 214 (or the transmitter 213) to the mobile antenna 220 to<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> maximize the power output. For example, the impedance of the power amplifier 214 (or the transmitter 213) may be adjusted by supplying the appropriate reactance to match the complex conjugate impedance of the mobile antenna 220 which accordingly maximizes the power output of the mobile antenna 220. In such example embodiments, the first power output state may require a maximum power output.</p><p id="p0088" num="0088">It will be appreciated that the implementation of tunable capacitors is one of a number of example embodiments to adjust the power output and/or match the impedance. For example, in at least some example embodiments, an impedance bridge may instead be implemented.</p><p id="p0089" num="0089">In at least some embodiments, the memory of the electronic device may include tuning information for each of the different power output states. The tuning information may specify how the tuning capacitors are to be adjusted for the conditions described above (e.g. head and hand, head only, hand only, free space).</p><p id="p0090" num="0090">As noted above, the electronic device 201 may detect the presence of a hand in other methods in other embodiments. For example, the electronic device 201 may additionally use orientation information of the electronic device 201 to determine whether a hand is in proximity to the electronic device 201. One such example embodiment will now be illustrated.</p><p id="p0091" num="0091">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 6</figref>, a flowchart of another example method of detecting a hand in proximity to the electronic device 201 is illustrated.

The orientation data may indicate the orientation of the electronic device 201 relative to the gravitational field of the earth at the particular point in time. That is, the orientation data may indicate the relative position of the electronic device 201 which may define any position in space. For example, the electronic device 201 may have a tilted orientation, flipped orientation, table-top orientation, etc.</p><p id="p0095" num="0095">Next at 606, the electronic device 201 may determine whether a hand is in proximity to the electronic device 201 based on the induced voltage and the orientation data.

The determination based on the induced voltage may be carried out in the same manner as described above with<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> reference to 504 of <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5</figref>.

In such example embodiments, even though a change in the induced voltage is detected which may be above a pre-determined threshold correlating to a hand (which is actually attributed to the surface), the electronic device 201 may determine that a hand is not near the electronic device 201 as the electronic device 201 has a table-top orientation.</p><p id="p0097" num="0097">While the present application is primarily described in terms of methods, a person of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the present application is also directed to various apparatus such as an electronic device 201 including a mobile communications device.
