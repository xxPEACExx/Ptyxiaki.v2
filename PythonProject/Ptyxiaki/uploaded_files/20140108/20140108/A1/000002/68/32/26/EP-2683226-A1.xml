An electronic device like this has a waterproof structure in which the opening is hermetically closed by the protective panel. Constructions that are described in patent documents 1, 2, are example of this kind of waterproof structure that is publically known.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In recent years, in an electronic device having a touch panel for operating a display of a display panel, the display face of the display panel tends to be increased in size and the usage environment of a user is greatly changed as the size of the display face increases. For this reason, the cases where the electronic device gets wet or has an impact applied thereto have increased in number.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Further, as the size of the display face of the electronic device increases, the electronic device is limited by the kind of materials which can be combined for use in the electronic device according to the linear expansion coefficients of the materials of constituent members. Therefore, increasing the size of the display face of the electronic device makes it difficult to ensure adequate waterproof characteristics and durability. Hence, in the electronic device provided with a touch panel, in particular, are strongly requested improvements in the waterproof property and in the resistance to impact of the display face of the display panel.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005"><!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> A section view of an example of a waterproof structure relating to the present invention is shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG 1</figref>. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG 1</figref>, waterproof structure 101 relating to the present invention includes: a housing 107 having opening 108; liquid crystal display panel 110 which is arranged opposite to opening 108 in the housing 107; and protective panel 111 which is arranged outside housing 107 and which closes opening 108. Protective panel 111 is arranged in such a way as to protect the display face of liquid display panel 110.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Housing 107 is constructed of first outer case 107a and second outer case 107b which are engaged with each other. A portion in which first outer case 107a is engaged with second outer case 107b has O ring 113 fitted therein and hence has airtightness ensured. Protective panel 111 is arranged on the outer side of first outer case 107a and is bonded to the peripheral edge portion of opening 108 by double-sided adhesive tape 116 to thereby close opening 108.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007"><ul><li>Patent document 1: Japanese Utility Model Application Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP58078685A"><text>58-78685</text></patcit></li><li>Patent document 2: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2005333290A"><text>2005-333290</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0003">Summary of Invention</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">By the way, as described above, the waterproof structure relating to the present invention has the following problems.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The first problem is described as follows: respective constituent members are different from each other in a linear expansion coefficient and hence a change in temperature causes a change to the outside dimension of the protective panel and the housing, whereby the constituent members are shifted in position from each other in the state where different kinds of constituent members are fitted in and combined with each other. For this reason, in the case where the constituent members are greatly moved in position, an adhesive force of an adhesive member such as a double-sided adhesive tape cannot endure a force developed by the constituent member being moved in position and hence the adhesive member is broken, which presents the problem of impairing the waterproof property.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The second problem is described as follows: the protective panel is directly fixed to the opening of the housing by the adhesive member, so that the protective panel directly receives an<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> impact applied thereto when the electronic device is dropped, thereby making it likely that the electronic device will break.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The third problem is described as follows: the protective panel in the waterproof structure described above is placed on the opening of the housing by the adhesive member, so that the center of an opposite face of the protective panel opposite to the liquid display panel is shifted from the center of the opening according to a variation in the position in which the protective panel is placed. As a result, the center of the display face of the liquid display panel is shifted from the center of the opposite face of the protective panel, which also presents the problem of causing faulty fabrication.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Hence, an object of the present invention is to provide a waterproof structure capable of solving any one of the relating technical problems described above and enhancing waterproof properties and enhancing resistance to impact, an electronic device having the waterproof structure, and a method for manufacturing the waterproof structure.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In order to achieve the object described above, a waterproof structure relating to the present invention includes: a housing which has an opening; a closing member which is arranged in the housing and which closes the opening; a waterproof member which is arranged on one face of the closing member in a direction perpendicular to an opening plane of the opening; a holding member which is arranged on the other face of the closing member in a direction perpendicular to the opening plane of the opening and which holds the closing member in such a way that the closing member can slide in a direction parallel to the opening plane of the opening; and an elastic member which is arranged such that it makes contact with an end portion of the closing member and which supports the closing member in such a way that the closing member can be displaced in a direction parallel to the opening plane of the opening. The closing member is supported by the housing in the state in which the closing member is sandwiched between the waterproof member and the holding member.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Further, an electronic device relating to the present invention includes a waterproof structure of the present invention.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Still further, a method for manufacturing a waterproof structure relating to the present<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> invention includes the steps of: sandwiching a closing member, which is arranged in a housing and which closes an opening of the housing, between a waterproof member, which is arranged on one face of the closing member in a direction perpendicular to an opening plane of the opening, and a holding member, which is arranged on the other face of the closing member in a direction perpendicular to the opening plane of the opening; and holding the closing member by the holding member which made contact with an end portion of the closing member in such a way that the closing member can be displaced in a direction parallel to the opening plane of the opening.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">According to the present invention, the closing member is movably supported by the holding member and the elastic member makes contact with the closing member, whereby waterproof properties can be enhanced and resistance to impact can be improved.</p><heading id="h0004">Brief Description of Drawings</heading><p id="p0017" num="0017"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG 1</figref>A section view showing a waterproof structure relating to the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG 2</figref>A perspective view showing an electronic device of a first embodiment.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG 3 </figref>A section view showing a main portion of a waterproof structure that the electronic device of the first embodiment has.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref> A perspective view showing a sliding plate of a waterproof structure in the first embodiment.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG 5</figref> A section view illustrating a movement of the waterproof structure in the first embodiment.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG 6</figref> A section view showing a waterproof structure according to a second embodiment.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG 7</figref> A section view showing a waterproof structure according to a third embodiment.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG 8</figref> A section view showing a waterproof structure according to a fourth embodiment.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 9</figref> A section view showing a waterproof structure according to a fifth embodiment.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">Description of Embodiments</heading><p id="p0018" num="0018"><!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> Hereinafter, specific embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><heading id="h0006">(First Embodiment)</heading><p id="p0019" num="0019">A perspective view of an electronic device of a first embodiment is shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG 2</figref>.
