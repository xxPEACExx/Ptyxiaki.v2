Adult neurogenesis occurs indisputably in two brain regions that give rise to two different types of neurons: the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (DG), where glutamatergic neurons are generated; and the subependymal zone (SEZ), where different classes of GABAergic neurons of the olfactory bulbs (OB) are generated. Recently, scientific research has started to study all the components of the neurogenic process, trying to unveil its functional importance through different techniques that allow to measure neurogenesis. Notably, the process of neurogenesis is dysfunctional in several diseases.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Several strategies have been developed to study adult neurogenesis. In order to successfully study the activity of stem-cells <i>in vivo,</i> it is necessary to identify<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> proliferative cells and stably label their cell progeny. In rodents, transgenic animal models, retroviral cell proliferation labeling and immunohistochemistry for bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) are robust technical approaches to study the generation and migration of newly-born cells in the adult brain. However, most of these techniques are not applicable in humans due to its high invasiveness.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Cell labeling with BrdU is a widely used and prevalent method for studying proliferation and neurogenesis <i>in vivo.</i> When injected systemically, BrdU (a thymidine analog) is incorporated in the DNA of proliferative cells, which are synthesizing new DNA, allowing the detection of these cells along their post-mitotic life cycle. This technique is pivotal for the identification of the source of neuronal cells formed de <i>novo</i> in the SGZ and SEZ adult brain regions. Additional studies with multiple cell stainings, where BrdU immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy were used, revealed that newborn neurons formed in the adult brain express a series of cell markers that reflect their maturation status. The identification of the maturation state of these newly-born neurons can thus be done by multiple labeling using BrdU and neuronal markers, such as NeuN. Other alternative methods were developed to measure proliferation <i>in vivo</i> using cell division markers, such as PCNA and Ki67, which are good markers for cells undergoing cell cycle. However, these cell markers are not suitable to detect the cell progeny (in contrast to BrdU, that is maintained in the progeny of the proliferating cells), as when the cells express mature neuronal markers, they already left the cell cycle.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Hence, other methods are necessary to detect adult neurogenesis and to unequivocally confirm its existence with BrdU labeling. Moreover, BrdU labeling does not allow for morphological and connectivity studies in newborn neurons of the adult brain, such as studies of the dendritic arborization and spine morphology. Therefore, an alternative cell labeling technique with retrovirus has been developed, which has become the most used method to study adult neurogenesis. Viral vectors are able to integrate in the genome of proliferative cells resulting in the permanent labeling of its entire progeny. In virtue of such characteristic, this method proved to be useful also to study the morphological and physiological development of newly-born neurons, along all their maturation phases, a feature not feasible with the BrdU immunohistochemistry technique. In fact, the detection of newborn neurons by retroviral vectors provides several other advantages, in comparison to BrdU immunohistochemistry. For example, retroviral labeling allows distinguishing between cell division and DNA repair, since viral integration in the host genome can only occur once the cell membrane has been disrupted during division. Furthermore, the method referent to the invention here described, allows for the labeling of the entire progeny of a proliferative cell, independently of the number of cell divisions, contrarily to BrdU staining that is diluted along divisions. Since the blood brain barrier is an obstacle for the entry of retroviral vectors in the brain, these viruses must be injected directly in the region of interest by stereotaxic surgeries, causing brain lesions associated to the canula implantation along with possible inflammatory reactions. This traumatic and pro-inflammatory method can induce<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> significant alterations in neurogenesis, which raises some constrains and putative confounding factors when studying the neurogenic process. Also, in the central nervous systems it was already reported that the incorporated retroviral construct might be silenced, and thus not be expressed in the daughter cells, bringing additional cautions to this method. Due to the possibility of occurring gene silencing in the viral construct of stem cells, it is not possible to assure that all the cell progeny is labeled. In addition, it is not known if retroviruses, once integrated, are subjected to epigenetic regulation that can undermine a clear interpretation of the results. Nevertheless, retroviral labeling is still considered the most robust method to study adult neurogenesis in the brain. However, considering the many disadvantages above mentioned, it is crucial to be cautious when interpreting neurogenesis measurements in the healthy brain as well as in the "diseased" brain. Therefore, there is a need of finding new and more consistent methods to study with greater accuracy this phenomena occurring in the adult brain.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Importantly, the neurogenic process, including proliferation of the stem cells and survival of the newly-born neurons, may be affected by different pathological conditions. In fact, previous studies showed that imbalances in adult hippocampal neurogenesis might underlie the pathophysiology of depression, as well as the action of antidepressant drugs, giving rise to the "neurogenic hypothesis of depression". Alterations in neuronal structure both in the hippocampus and in the prefrontal cortex are known to be key processes in the pathophysiology<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> of depression. Interestingly, there is a strong contribution of the synaptic plasticity and neuronal connectivity to the development and recovery of a depressive behavior. In fact, synaptic connections, disrupted in depressed individuals are reestablished by antidepressants treatment, such as fluoxetine and imipramine, promoting the recovery of the neuronal circuits.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In the majority of these studies, the assessment of the dendritic arborization and spine morphology have been performed by three-dimensional morphometric analysis, using computer-automated virtual reconstructions, in the hippocampus and cortex. Despite being possible to study neuronal morphology in areas of interest, this technique does not allow to distinguish older pre-existing neurons from newly generated neurons, which are specifically affected by the disease and treatment. Therefore, it becomes fundamental to design an alternative method that allows studying the morphology and connectivity specifically of newborn neurons, by being able to identify them. A good alternative would be to use retroviral labeling of newborn cells and simultaneously to study neuronal structure, including dendritic and axonal projections. However, due to the several disadvantages mentioned before, using retroviruses requires many precautions in the subsequent interpretation of the obtained results, especially in pathological scenarios. Besides that, this method involves a surgery and thus it is invasive, making impossible to use this method in humans. For this reason, it is valuable to have a technique that allows simultaneously labeling the newborn neurons and<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> studying their morphology, avoiding problems such as lesions and inflammatory reactions in the brain region of interest. In this sense, the innovative and non-invasive method of the present invention allows obtaining these objectives with success through a method that combines immunohistochemistry for BrdU with Golgi-Cox impregnation in neurons.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Summary of the invention</b></heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">The methodology for labeling of neurons described in the present invention combines immunohistochemistry for bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) with the Golgi-Cox impregnation technique.

Herein we describe a novel method developed by us that successfully allows the accomplishment of these objectives by combining bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) immunohistochemistry labeling with Golgi-impregnated neuron analysis <b>(</b><figref idrefs="f0001"><b>Fig. 1</b></figref><b>).</b> With this new method we can trace newborn neurons using BrdU labeling and study their structure, including dendritic arborization and spine shape, by simultaneous analysis of Golgi-impregnated neurons. To validate this method, we studied neurons that showed co-labeling of BrdU and Golgi-Cox staining using confocal microscopy <b>(</b><figref idrefs="f0001"><b>Figs. 1</b></figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002"><b>2</b></figref><b>)</b> and performed elaborated three-dimensional morphometric analysis of the Golgi-impregnated neurons using computer-assisted reconstructions <b>(</b><figref idrefs="f0001"><b>Figs. 1</b></figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002"><b>2</b></figref><b>).</b> All branches of the dendritic tree of the selected neurons were reconstructed using a motorized microscope and Neurolucida software with the AutoNeuron extension module <b>(</b><figref idrefs="f0001"><b>Fig. 1B</b></figref><figref idrefs="f0001"><b>, C)</b></figref>and using manual reconstruction without the AutoNeuron extension <b>(</b><figref idrefs="f0001"><b>Fig. 1D</b></figref><b>).</b> As we can show in the figures, no significant differences in total dendritic length per neuron were found between the automatic AutoNeuron and manual reconstructions, thus showing that distinct reconstruction strategies can be used to study the structure of these neurons. A three-dimensional analysis of the reconstructed neurons was performed using NeuroExplorer software (Microbrightfield). This method also allows the analysis of spine types <b>(</b><figref idrefs="f0001"><b>Fig. 1E</b></figref><b>)</b> which provides information on neuronal connectivity and synaptic plasticity.<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --></p><p id="p0036" num="0036">To validate this method, we studied the structure of newborn neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) of control rats <b>(</b><figref idrefs="f0001"><b>Figs. 1</b></figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002"><b>2</b></figref><b>)</b> and compared to the DG neurons of rats displaying depressive-like symptoms after exposure to chronic mild stress (CMS) and/or to the administration of methyazoxymethanol (MAM), an alkylating agent that arrests cellular proliferation. It is well established that proliferation of neuronal progenitors and survival of newborn neurons can be regulated by physiological and pathological conditions. Indeed, previous studies have proposed that imbalances in adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus could be involved in the pathophysiology of depression and in the actions of antidepressant drugs. Additionally, it recently emerged that the expression of depressive-like behavior in CMS rats is associated with decreased proliferation in the hippocampus, but also with dendritic atrophy and synaptic loss in this brain region. Strikingly, there is a potential contribution of synaptic plasticity and neuronal connectivity to the development of, and recovery from, depressive-like behavior, as these synaptic connections can be restored by antidepressants, facilitating the rewiring of neural circuits. In most of these studies, the assessment of dendritic arborization and spine shape of neurons was performed by three-dimensional morphometric analysis of Golgi-impregnated neurons in the hippocampus without making possible to distinguish between old non-affected neurons and newly-born neurons that were affected by the disease or by the treatment. The distinction between these two types of neurons is of extreme importance to convincingly study the effect of a disease and its treatment in the newly formed neurons of the brain. These studies were not possible to perform until<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> now as the researchers didn't have any available method that could allow analyzing specifically the newly-born neurons affected by the disease and treatment. With the new method of the present invention we can label the neurons that were born during the period of CMS using staining for BrdU and study simultaneously their cell shape, including dendritic processes by Golgi-Cox staining.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Thus, we could compare specifically the morphology of newborn neurons in rats subjected to unpredictable CMS with and without MAM administration <b>(</b><figref idrefs="f0002"><b>Fig. 2B</b></figref> and <figref idrefs="f0001"><b>C)</b></figref>with newborn neurons of control rats <b>(</b><figref idrefs="f0002"><b>Fig. 2A</b></figref><b>).</b> We show here that newborn neurons from the DG of rats subjected to CMS without blockage of neurogenesis are able to recover morphologically <b>(</b><figref idrefs="f0002"><b>Fig. 2B</b></figref><b>, E, G</b> and <b>H)</b> and are comparable to newborn neurons of control untreated rats <b>(</b><figref idrefs="f0002"><b>Fig. 2A</b></figref><b>, D, G</b> and <b>H).</b> These findings also show for the first time that the newborn neurons from the DG of rats subjected to CMS and injected with MAM are severely compromised and are not able to recover in terms of cell shape and dendritic arborization even one month after stress exposure <b>(</b><figref idrefs="f0002"><b>Fig. 2C</b></figref><b>, F, G</b> and <b>H).</b></p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Given that neuroplasticity, or its failure, is crucial in several neuropathological processes, it becomes extremely relevant to compare the neuronal structure of newly-born cells in comparison to those of previously existent cells. So far, the analysis of the dendritic and synaptic structure of newly-born neurons could only be achieved by retroviral labeling. However, this method has several disadvantages, in comparison to our novel method, as for example being and invasive method that causes lesions and<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> local inflammatory reactions that make it less suitable for use in <i>in vivo</i> studies. These possible lesions and inflammation reactions may induce alterations on neurogenesis, thus raising some cautions when using this method to study stem cell activity in the brain in a neurophatological context. Moreover, this approach only permits the study of the region where the virus was injected and does not allow for precise temporal resolution of proliferation nor for the comparison of the neuronal morphology between dividing and non-dividing cells. All these disadvantages are overcome by the method of the present invention.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Noteworthy that standard histopathological techniques used to label neurons do not stain dendrites and spines and thus may miss aberrant dendritic branching and synaptic loss in neurodegenerative processes. In contrast, the Golgi silver impregnation is a simple and valuable method that provides detailed information on neuronal morphology of the neurons allowing the detection of subtle neuronal damages or degeneration. As shown with the present invention, if the Golgi-Cox impregnation is combined with BrdU staining, this technique will further allow distinguishing whether these changes target specific neuronal populations (e.g. in the present study, whether they affect differently old versus newly born neurons). Obviously, the applicability of this method is much broader, as the combination of other markers and Golgi will allow the analysis of the neuronal dendritic structure with its phenotypic characterization in a wide spectrum of experimental conditions. Most importantly is the fact that this method can be applied to humans, as it is non-invasive, in contrast to the most used methods<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> nowadays, more precisely the retroviral injections method.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">In summary, this novel simple and non-invasive method will be a useful tool to study the fine neuronal structure in phenotypically characterized neurons in both physiological and pathological conditions. The methodology of the present invention, is useful for all those pathological conditions in which neurogenesis and dendritic/synaptic plasticity might be affected, such as in depression, Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia.</p><heading id="h0011"><b>References</b></heading><p id="p0041" num="0041"><ol><li>1. <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Alvarez-Buylla, A., Garcia-Verdugo, J.M. &amp; Tramontin, A.D.
