<!-- EPO <DP n="3"/>-->
 In such devices it is difficult to determine if the wheel has been lifted and anchored successfully. </p><p id="p0009" num="0009"> The increasing effort required on the wrench for operating the actuator is not a sufficient indication that the spare wheel has been properly anchored in the correct position; in fact, in some cases the wheel may not be seated correctly and abut against the edges of the housing, so that it cannot be fully and properly inserted into its compartment . </p><p id="p0010" num="0010"> In this incorrect position, the user will nevertheless perceive an increasing resistance when turning the wrench, which may be mistaken for the correct end-of-travel position of a properly seated wheel. </p><p id="p0011" num="0011"> The present invention aims at solving the above problems by providing a safety device adapted to signal to the user when the spare wheel has been successfully and properly anchored in its compartment, e.g. by means of a clearly visible signal that cannot be misinterpreted by the user . </p><p id="p0012" num="0012"> One aspect of the present invention relates to a device for lifting and lowering a spare wheel having the features set out in the appended claim 1. </p><p id="p0013" num="0013"> Further accessory features of the present invention are set out in dependent claims. </p><p id="p0014" num="0014"> The features and advantages of the present device will become apparent from the following description of some embodiments thereof with reference to the annexed drawings, wherein : </p><p id="p0015" num="0015"> • Fig. 1 shows one embodiment of the device for lifting and lowering a spare wheel; 
<!-- EPO <DP n="4"/>-->
 • Fig. 2 shows a detail of the actuator comprising one embodiment of the safety device according to the present invention; </p><p id="p0016" num="0016"> • Figs. 3A, 3B and 3C show orthogonal -proj ection views of the actuator of Fig. 2; </p><p id="p0017" num="0017"> • Figs. 4A, 4B and 4C show some details of the device; in particular, Fig. 4A shows the end portion of the guide tube where the flexible cable slides; Fig. 4B shows the seal comprised in the activation portion of the actuator according to the present invention; Fig. 4C shows the closing element; </p><p id="p0018" num="0018"> • Fig. 5 is a block diagram of the embodiment of Fig. 5;</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">• Fig. 6 shows a detail of the embodiment of Fig. 5. </p><p id="p0020" num="0020"> With reference to the above-listed drawings, the device for lifting and lowering the spare wheel R of a vehicle comprises an actuator 3, preferably arranged in the boot of the vehicle, at least one flexible cable 2, operated through actuator 3, and a hooking element 5, secured to one end of flexible cable 2 and adapted to anchor wheel R in a suitable compartment 7, as shown in Fig. 1. </p><p id="p0021" num="0021"> Said device further comprises a safety device 4 adapted to signal to the user that the spare wheel has been successfully and properly anchored in compartment 7. </p><p id="p0022" num="0022"> In the preferred embodiment shown in Fig. 2, actuator 3 comprises a plurality of mechanisms (not shown) adapted to move the cable; an activation portion 31, preferably arranged in a position which can be seen by the user when operating the device for lifting wheel R. </p><p id="p0023" num="0023"> Said activation portion 31 comprises a protection cup or guard 32 adapted to insulate the mechanical portion of 
<!-- EPO <DP n="5"/>-->
actuator 3, where there is an activation nut 33 which is mechanically connected to the plurality of mechanisms included in actuator 3 and with which a suitable wrench can be associated in order to operate actuator 3. </p><p id="p0024" num="0024"> The concave shape of said cup 32 is such that it seals the activation portion of actuator 3 against external agents while allowing the activation nut to be turned by means of the wrench; this rotation allows actuator 3 to pull o release flexible cable 2 for lifting or lowering spare wheel R. </p><p id="p0025" num="0025"> When wheel R is correctly secured in its compartment 7, said cable 2 is collected in a holder included, for example, in actuator 3. </p><p id="p0026" num="0026"> Flexible cable 2, which is connected to wheel hooking element 5, slides within a guide tube 21, which is connected to cup 32 to allow cable 2 to slide to/from the holder . </p><p id="p0027" num="0027"> In particular, said cup 32 comprises a fitting portion 36 into which said guide tube 21, where cable 2 can slide, is inserted. </p><p id="p0028" num="0028"> Said fitting portion 36 preferably has a tubular shape and is positioned in the outer portion of cup 32, as shown in Figs. 2, 3B, 3C and 4C. </p><p id="p0029" num="0029"> In the preferred embodiment, as shown in Figs. 2, 3A, 3B, 3C, 4A, 4B and 4C, safety device 4 comprises a slot or window 41 in fitting portion 36 of cup 32, where flexible cable 2 slides, so as to make cable 2 sliding therein visible; and a marking 41, e.g. a colored paint marking, on cable 2, which is adapted to signal the proper position of wheel R in compartment 7 
<!-- EPO <DP n="6"/>-->
when it matches window 41, thus being clearly visible to the user. </p><p id="p0030" num="0030"> In the present embodiment, if wheel R is properly positioned, marking 42 will become visible through window 41 after removing the wrench from activation portion 31. </p><p id="p0031" num="0031"> In particular, said tube 21 is connected to a first end of the tubular fitting portion 36, which tube 21 also comprises a window 22, which matches window 41 of safety device 4 when said tube 21 is properly inserted in fitting portion 36 of cup 32. A fastening portion 211 is adapted to ensure constant adhesion between tube 21 and fitting portion 36, as shown in Fig. 4A. </p><p id="p0032" num="0032"> In the second end a closing element 45 is inserted, as shown in Fig. 4B, which comprises at least one transparent portion allowing visibility inside the tube and preventing dust and dirt from entering actuator 3, which might damage the mechanical components thereof, remove marking 42 from cable 2 or obstruct window 41, thus making it impossible for the user to verify the correct positioning of wheel R in compartment 7. </p><p id="p0033" num="0033"> The transparent portion of closing element 45, when said element is positioned in fitting portion 36, matches and seals window 41 and window 22 on guide tube 21, thus preventing the entrance of dust and making cable 2 and marking 42 thereof visible to the user. </p><p id="p0034" num="0034"> In an alternative embodiment (not shown) , actuator 3 is activated by means of an electric nutrunner, which is associated with activation nut 33. </p><p id="p0035" num="0035"> Said nutrunner is advantageously positioned near actuator 3, which is normally located in the vehicle's boot . 
<!-- EPO <DP n="7"/>-->
 This alternative embodiment eliminates the need for manual wrench operation, thereby reducing the user's effort . </p><p id="p0036" num="0036"> In an alternative embodiment, shown in Figs. 5 and 6, safety device 4 is implemented by using an electric circuit comprising a sensor 43, e.g. a proximity sensor, which is adapted to detect when cable 2 has been pulled to a height corresponding to the proper position of wheel R inside compartment 7. </p><p id="p0037" num="0037"> As soon as said height is detected by sensor 43, a luminous and/or audible signaling device 44 is activated in order to signal to the user that wheel R has been properly positioned in the compartment. </p><p id="p0038" num="0038"> Sensor 43 is arranged, for example, in fitting portion 36 whereto guide tube 21, in which cable 2 slides, is connected . </p><p id="p0039" num="0039"> In a preferred embodiment, shown in Fig. 6, said sensor 43 is adapted to automatically detect the presence of a marking 42, e.g. made of magnetic material, which is adapted to energize sensor 43. </p><p id="p0040" num="0040"> Sensor 43 and signaling device 44 are electrically connected to an electronic circuit 6 cooperating with the electric/electronic circuit of the vehicle, for monitoring and controlling said electronic devices. </p><p id="p0041" num="0041"> The embodiment shown in Fig. 6 requires no slot or window 41 on guard 32, because the user is not required to monitor the presence of marking 42 in window 41, since this task is automatically carried out by the electronic circuit 6 that controls and monitors sensor 43. </p><p id="p0042" num="0042"> Said signaling device 44 is preferably positioned in a place where it can be clearly seen by the user, e.g. in the 
<!-- EPO <DP n="8"/>-->
