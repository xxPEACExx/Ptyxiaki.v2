compressor and a turbine of a gas turbine, or a steam turbine and so on, a structure is known in which a stationary vane unit is disposed in the inner periphery of a casing extending along the outer periphery of a rotor. In the stationary vane unit, a plurality of stationary vane members is arranged around a central axis of rotation of the rotor for rotary machine, and outer shrouds formed in the outer peripheries of the stationary vane members are continuous in the circumferential direction so as to be connected to each other. As such a stationary vane unit, for example, as disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2009002338A"><text>JP-A-2009-2338</text></patcit>, the outer shrouds connected to each other in an annular shape are connected to inner shrouds by welding, so that the plurality of stationary vane members is integrated with each other.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">However, when the plurality of stationary vane members is integrated with each other by welding as described above, a large amount of welding heat is input to the outer shroud and the stationary vane body, so that they are thermally deformed.

However, there is no change in the fact that the plurality of stationary vane members is connected to each other by welding, and the thermal deformation may occur due to the heat input. As a result, there is a problem in that the precision with respect to the design value is degraded.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The invention is made in view of such circumstances, and the object of the invention is to provide a stationary vane unit with high precision with respect to the design value.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">According to an aspect of the invention, there is provided a stationary vane unit of a rotary machine in which a plurality of stationary vane members is arranged around a central axis and outer shrouds formed in the outer peripheries of the stationary vane members are continuous in the circumferential direction so as to be connected to each other, the stationary vane unit including: a first band member that extends in the circumferential direction and comes into contact with the outer shrouds of the plurality of stationary vane members from one side thereof in the main axial direction in which the central axis extends; a second band member that extends in the circumferential direction and comes into contact with the outer shrouds of the plurality of stationary vane members from the other side thereof in the main axial direction; and a fastening member that fastens the first band member and the second band member to each other so that the outer shrouds of the plurality of stationary vane members are connected to each other.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In this way, since the first band member and the second band member are fastened to each other so that the outer shrouds of the plurality of stationary vane members are connected to each other, there is no need to perform welding for the connection of the stationary vane members. Accordingly, since the stationary vane members can be prevented from being thermally deformed during the process of assembling the stationary vane members, the assembly precision can be improved.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> Thus, the stationary vane unit with high precision with respect to the design value can be obtained.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Further, at least one of the first band member and the second band member is fitted to the outer shrouds of the plurality of stationary vane members.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In this way, at least one of the first band member and the second band member is fitted to the outer shrouds of the plurality of stationary vane member. For this reason, a positional deviation of the first band member or the second band member fitted to the outer shroud with respect to the outer shroud can be suppressed, and the precision with respect to the design value can be further improved.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Further, the fastening member penetrates the outer shrouds in the main axial direction.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In this way, since the fastening member penetrates the outer shroud in the main axial direction, the fastening member is positioned inside the stationary vane unit. Accordingly, since the fastening member does not protrude outward from the stationary vane unit, the configuration can be made compact.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Further, a plurality of the fastening members is provided at intervals in the circumferential direction, and at least one stationary vane member is positioned between two fastening members which make a pair and are adjacent to each other in the circumferential direction when seen from the main axial direction.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In this way, since at least one stationary vane member is positioned between two fastening members, at least two or more stationary vane members can be fastened to each other by two fastening members. Accordingly, since the number of the fastening members decreases compared to the number of the stationary vane members, the number of components can be reduced.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Further, at least one of the first band member and the second band member is formed in an annular shape.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In this way, since at least one of the first band member and the second band member is formed in an annular shape, the structure is stable and the rigidity improves. Accordingly, since the deformation is suppressed, the precision with respect to the design value can be improved.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018"><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> Further, at least one of the first band member and the second band member is formed in an annular shape and is divided into multiple circular-arc-band-like bodies.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In this way, since at least one of the first band member and the second band member is divided into multiple circular-arc-band-like bodies, the manufacturing tolerance can be adjusted by adjusting the positions of the circular-arc-band-like bodies.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Further, at least one of the first band member and the second band member is buried in the outer shroud of the stationary vane member, and includes a crushed portion which is plastically deformed toward the outer shroud.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In this way, since at least one of the first band member and the second band member includes the crushed portion, the crushed portion comes into close contact with the outer shroud in a manner such that the first band member or the second band member provided with the crushed portion is relatively displaced toward the outer shroud. Accordingly, the rattling between the second band member and the outer shroud can be sufficiently suppressed.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Further, the outer shroud includes a penetration portion through which the fastening member passes and which extends from one side of the circumferential direction toward the other side thereof.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In this way, the penetration position of the fastening member can be minutely adjusted in the circumferential direction during the assembly. Accordingly, since the ease of the assembly improves, the assembly work can be performed in a short amount of time.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Further, according to another aspect of invention, there is provided a method of producing a stationary vane unit of a rotary machine in which a plurality of stationary vane members is arranged around a central axis and outer shrouds formed in the outer peripheries of the stationary vane members are continuous in the circumferential direction so as to be connected to each other, the method including: a preparing step of preparing the plurality of stationary vane members, a first band member which extends in the circumferential direction and can be fitted to one end portions of the outer shrouds from one side of the main axial direction in which the central axis extends, and a second band member which extends in the circumferential direction around the central axis and can be fitted to the other end portions of the outer shrouds from the other side of the main axial direction; an arranging step of arranging the plurality of stationary vane members in<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> the circumferential direction while one end portions of the outer shrouds of the stationary vane members are fitted to one of the first band member and the second band member placed on a work support surface; a fitting step of fitting the other of the first band member and the second band member to the other end portions of the plurality of outer shrouds continuous in the circumferential direction; and a fastening step of fastening the first band member and the second band member to each other so that the outer shrouds of the plurality of stationary vane members are connected to each other.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In this way, the plurality of stationary vane members can be arranged in the circumferential direction while one end portion of the outer shroud of the stationary vane member is fitted to one of the first band member and the second band member placed on the work support surface. Further, the other of the first band member and the second band member is fitted to the other end portions of the plurality of circumferentially continuous outer shrouds of the plurality of stationary vane members arranged in the circumferential direction. For this reason, the first band member and the second band member can be easily positioned with respect to the outer shroud by the fitting between one end portion and the first band member and the fitting between the other end portion and the second band member. Accordingly, since the workability improves, the stationary vane unit can be easily and highly precisely assembled.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Further, no heat input to the stationary vane member occurs due to the connection of the stationary vane member. Accordingly, since the stationary vane member can be prevented from being thermally deformed during the process of assembling the stationary vane member, the assembly precision can be improved.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Thus, the stationary vane unit with high precision with respect to the design value can be obtained.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Further, in the preparing step, one end portion of the outer shroud of the stationary vane member is provided with a concave portion, and one of the first band member and the second band member is provided with a convex portion which includes a base portion extending in the circumferential direction and formed in a flat shape and a reference surface protruding in the perpendicular direction and extending in the circumferential direction.
