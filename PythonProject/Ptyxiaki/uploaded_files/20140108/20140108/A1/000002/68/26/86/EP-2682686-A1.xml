(for example, see Patent Literature 1).</p><heading id="h0003">Citation List</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">Patent Literature 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP9229457A"><text>9-229457</text></patcit> (Abstract)</p><heading id="h0005">Summary of Invention</heading><heading id="h0006">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004"><!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> In a refrigerating and air-conditioning apparatus in the related art that can simultaneously perform cooling and heating, a relay unit is provided with a plurality of branch ports for a refrigerant pipe, and indoor units are connected to the respective branch ports. Because the relay unit needs to control flow switching valves and the like based on whether the indoor units are in operation or are stopped or whether the indoor units are operating in a cooling mode or a heating mode, it is necessary to perform the control by identifying which indoor unit is connected to which branch port. Therefore, connected-branch-port numbers or connected-indoor-unit numbers need to be set at the indoor units or the relay unit by using DIP switches or the like.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">However, when setting the connected-branch-port numbers or the connected-indoor-unit numbers at the indoor units or the relay unit by using DIP switches or the like, each indoor unit or the relay unit requires setting means, such as a DIP switch, which involves a problem in that the component cost is increased and a troublesome task is required in the setting process. In addition, there is another problem in that the operation cannot be performed properly if this setting means is set incorrectly.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Furthermore, if the connections are to be automatically determined by controlling the flow control valves and measuring temperature changes in the indoor heat exchangers, as in Patent Literature 1 described above, the temperature data of each indoor heat exchanger needs to be transmitted to the relay unit by communication. In order to allow for exchanging of such temperature data, programs that use the same communication protocol need to be provided for a transmission process performed by microcomputers of controllers in the indoor units and a reception analysis process performed by a microcomputer of a controller in the relay unit. This is a problem in that there are limitations with respect to indoor units that can be connected to the relay unit.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">An example of limitations with respect to indoor units that can be connected to the relay unit, as mentioned above, will be described below.<br/>
<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --><figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating the configuration of an indoor-unit controller and a relay-unit controller in the related art provided with a function for controlling a flow control valve and measuring a temperature change in an indoor heat exchanger so as to automatically determine the connection. In <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8</figref>, a relay-unit controller 63b and an indoor-unit controller 62 are connected by transmission lines 71. The transmission lines 71 connect transmission circuits and reception circuits of the relay-unit controller 63b and the indoor-unit controller 62. The transmission circuit and the reception circuit in each controller are connected to a microcomputer in the controller, and the microcomputer performs a transmission process and a reception analysis process.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 9</figref> illustrates the flow of data when transmitting temperature data of an indoor heat exchanger from the indoor-unit controller 62 to the relay-unit controller 63b in the related art. First, the temperature data is converted into a transmittable digital signal by a transmission process performed by the indoor-unit controller 62. Furthermore, the digital signal is converted into a signal waveform by the transmission circuit, and the signal waveform is transmitted to the relay unit via the transmission line. In the relay-unit controller 63b, the reception circuit reversely-converts the signal waveform into a digital signal. Furthermore, the digital signal is reversely-converted into temperature data by a reception analysis process so that the temperature data can be received.<br/>
Accordingly, in the related art, programs that use the same communication protocol need to be provided for both of the transmission process performed by the microcomputer in the indoor-unit controller 62 and the reception analysis process performed by the microcomputer in the relay-unit controller 63b in order to perform transmission and reception of the temperature data.<br/>
Moreover, expensive circuit configurations are necessary because the reception circuit in the relay-unit controller 63b and the transmission circuit in the indoor-unit controller 62 need to be connectable to each other and also need to satisfy limiting conditions with respect to the operating speed.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In the related art, the relay unit and each indoor unit are connectable only if the combination thereof satisfies the limiting conditions thereof. This is a problem in that the units cannot be readily connected if they are products provided by different manufacturers.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In addition, there is another problem in that the configuration for the communication between the relay unit and each indoor unit is complicated.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The present invention has been made to solve the aforementioned problems, and a first object thereof is to provide a refrigerating and air-conditioning apparatus that achieves reduced limitations with respect to the communication of indoor units and can identify which indoor unit is connected to each branch port.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">A second object is to provide a refrigerating and air-conditioning apparatus that can detect a setting error with respect to the connection between each branch port and each indoor unit.</p><heading id="h0007">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p0013" num="0013">A refrigerating and air-conditioning apparatus according to the present invention includes a refrigeration cycle that makes a refrigerant circulate therethrough by connecting a compressor, a heat-source-side heat exchanger, at least one expansion valve, and at least one intermediate heat exchanger; and a heat-medium circuit that makes a heat medium circulate therethrough by connecting at least one pump, a plurality of use-side heat exchangers, and the intermediate heat exchanger. The at least one intermediate heat exchanger and the pump are accommodated in a relay unit. The plurality of use-side heat exchangers are accommodated in respective indoor units. Each indoor unit includes an indoor-unit controller that performs on-off control for operation performed by the use-side heat exchanger for exchanging heat between the heat medium and a thermal load. The relay unit includes a plurality of branch ports that are connected to the plurality of use-side heat exchangers and make the heat medium circulate to the use-side heat exchangers,<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> outlet temperature sensors that are provided for the respective branch ports and each detect an outlet temperature of the heat medium flowing out of the branch port to the corresponding use-side heat exchanger, inlet temperature sensors that are provided for the respective branch ports and each detect an inlet temperature of the heat medium flowing into the branch port from the corresponding use-side heat exchanger, and a relay-unit controller that is connected to the indoor-unit controllers by a transmission line and controls operation of each indoor-unit by transmitting an operation command or a stop command thereto via the transmission line. The relay-unit controller makes the indoor units operate on a one-by-one basis and identifies which of the indoor units is connected to each branch port on the basis of a difference between the inlet temperature and the outlet temperature at the branch port.
