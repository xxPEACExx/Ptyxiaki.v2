As a matter of fact, nutrias are carriers of infective viruses both for human beings and for breeding animals and, therefore, cause significant health and hygiene problems. Furthermore, nutrias normally build their underground burrows in correspondence to the banks of watercourses, thus causing their weakening and provoking significant hydrogeological damages, especially in case of floods.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The health and hygiene problems as well as the environmental damages caused by nutrias were the subject of researches and studies carried on by the non-governmental organisation IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature), which, based on the results of these researches, deemed it necessary for nutrias to be inserted in the list of the hounded most dangerous alien species in the world, namely animals that were introduced by human beings in a new habitat.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In the light of the numerous problems described above,<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> in recent years a need strongly arose to control the number of nutrias so as to keep it below a predetermined numerical threshold, in order to guarantee, on the one hand, an environmental balance and, on the other hand, the reduction of the health and hygiene risks for human beings, pets and breeding animals.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">To this aim, different techniques for the reduction of the number of nutrias have been developed, the most of effective of which proved to be the technique that envisages injecting gas into their burrows.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In order to minimize the suffering of nutrias during the gas injection into the burrow, the European Union issued the regulation EC no. 1099/2009, which requires the presence of a predetermined concentration of carbon monoxide CO in the gas mixture injected into the burrow, namely a concentration raging from 2 to 4%.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Hence, the need arose to provide a system that is able to precisely guarantee the presence of a carbon monoxide CO percentage in accordance with the provisions of the European regulation.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Though, this need has not been fulfilled yet due to different technical problems that have not been solved yet.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In particular, the concentration of carbon monoxide injected into the burrow is highly variable/unstable, since, on the one hand, the burrow of the nutria has at<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> least one opening that leads to the outside and allows the gas mixture to flow towards the outside, thus causing a consequent quick and uncontrolled reduction of the concentration of carbon monoxide in the burrow, and, on the other hand, the gas mixture injected is partly absorbed by the soil with absorption degrees that vary as a function of the type/composition/structure of the soil itself and of its humidity level.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The American patent application no. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US20070277428A"><text>US2007/0277428A</text></patcit> describes a method to control rodents, which comprises the steps of using an internal combustion engine to produce an exhaust gas; cooling the exhaust gas; compressing the exhaust gas so as to pressurize it inside a tank; and injecting the pressurized exhaust gas into the burrow through an injector.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The solution described in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US20070277428A"><text>US2007/0277428A</text></patcit> has the big drawback that it does not involve any control of the concentration of the carbon monoxide present inside the burrow.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The patent application no. <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="DE202010014984U1"><text>DE 20 2010 014984 U1</text></patcit> describes a system to control the injection of gas into a burrow, the system comprising: a tubular container pointed at one end, which is structured so as to be at least partially fitted with the point inside the burrow and is configured to adjust the injection of carbon dioxide into<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> the burrow by means of a flow control organ;
