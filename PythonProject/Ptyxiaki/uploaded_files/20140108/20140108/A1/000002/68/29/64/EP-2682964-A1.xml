The variable capacitance type capacitor described in this Patent Document 1 includes, as mechanistic structural parts housed within a long and thin cylindrical casing, a first conductor attached to one end surface of a cylindrical dielectric and a flexible second conductor capable of elastic displacement disposed on another end surface side of the dielectric opposite to the one end surface of the dielectric. A surface of the second conductor, which faces the dielectric, has such a shape as to swell in the form of a dome toward the dielectric, for example.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The variable capacitance type capacitor described in Patent Document 1 also includes a spacer for separating the second conductor from the other end surface of the dielectric by a small interval except for a portion of the second conductor and the other end surface of the dielectric. The variable capacitance type capacitor also includes a part for applying a relative pressure or displacement between the second conductor and the dielectric. The part for applying the relative pressure or displacement is coupled to a core body of the pen-shaped position indicator. When a pen pressure is applied to the position indicator from one end part of the casing of the position indicator, a force applied in an axial direction to the core body displaces the flexible second<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> conductor toward the dielectric side, and thus causes the second conductor to touch the other end surface of the dielectric. Then, the swelling end surface of the flexible second conductor is in the shape of a dome touches the other end surface of the dielectric with a contact area corresponding to the pressing force. Therefore a capacitance formed between the second conductor and the first conductor with the dielectric interposed therebetween changes.</p><heading id="h0004">[Prior Art Document]</heading><heading id="h0005">[Patent Document]</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">[Patent Document 1]<br/>
Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JPHEI0496212B"><text>Hei 04-96212</text></patcit></p><heading id="h0006">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0007">[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">The variable capacitance type capacitor of the position indicator in Patent Document 1 described above has a large number of parts, including the dielectric, the first conductor, the second conductor, the spacer, a holding body for holding the dielectric, terminal members for connecting the first and second conductors to a printed wiring board, and the like. In addition, each of the parts is a separate mechanism part. Therefore, the construction of the position indicator is complex, and also it requires time to assemble the position indicator. The construction of the position indicator thus entails high cost and is unsuitable for mass production.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">For mass production, the variable capacitance type capacitor described in Patent Document 1 may be formed as a modularized part by putting together the many parts in advance. However, position indicators in the shape of a pen have recently been desired to be thinner in view of that portable type electronic devices have been miniaturized such as PDAs, advanced portable telephone terminals (smartphones), and the like.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">However, the variable capacitance type capacitor of the position indicator in Patent Document 1 described above has a plurality of groups of parts arranged in a direction of application of pressure, and elastically displaces the second conductor according to applied pressure. Thus, when the groups of parts are put together into a modularized part in advance, the parts need to be housed within a predetermined hosing member, and it is difficult to miniaturize the modularized part. Therefore the modularized part presents a problem in thinning the pen-shaped position<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> indicator. In addition, the thinner the pen-shaped position indicator becomes, the more difficult it is to secure a space between the second conductor and the other end surface of the dielectric.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In addition, when a modularized part is made by putting together a predetermined group of parts, it takes time to put together the group of parts. Thus, a worker needs to take time to put together the group of parts into the modularized part, and thereafter combine the modularized part with other parts and dispose the parts within a case, which results in poor productivity.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In view of the above points, according to one aspect of the present invention, a variable capacitance type capacitor is provided, which has a simple construction, can be easily housed in a thin type casing such as that of a position indicator or the like, and can be readily put into mass production.</p><heading id="h0008">[Means for Solving the Problems]</heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">In order to solve the above problems, according to the present invention, there is provided a variable capacitance type capacitor including: an inside member; and an outside member including a space for housing the inside member; the inside member having a columnar shape, and having a first conductor pattern formed on a circumferential surface of the inside member; the outside member being a dielectric having a predetermined dielectric constant, and having a second conductor pattern formed on an outer circumferential surface of the outside member, the second conductor pattern being disposed so as to oppose the first conductor pattern formed on the circumferential surface of the inside member when the inside member is housed in the space of the outside member; and the inside member housed in the space of the outside member and having the columnar shape being displaced relative to the outside member in a direction of a central axis of the inside member having the columnar shape in response to an externally applied force, whereby an opposed area formed between the first conductor pattern and the second conductor pattern disposed with the dielectric interposed between the first conductor pattern and the second conductor pattern changes, and a capacitance corresponding to the externally applied force is formed between the first conductor pattern and the second conductor pattern.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In the variable capacitance type capacitor according to the present invention, the inside member is displaced relative to the outside member in the direction of the central axis of the columnar shape of the inside member in response to the externally applied force, whereby the first conductor pattern is displaced relative to the second conductor pattern, and the opposed area between the first conductor pattern and the second conductor pattern that oppose each other with the<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> dielectric of the outside member interposed between the first conductor pattern and the second conductor pattern changes according to the applied pressure. The variable capacitance type capacitor according to the present invention therefore has the capacitance corresponding to the externally applied force between a first electrode and a second electrode.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The variable capacitance type capacitor according to the present invention is formed with the inside member housed within the space of the outside member, and is thus formed as a capacitor having a simple construction essentially formed as one device. The variable capacitance type capacitor according to the present invention, having the construction housing the inside member of the columnar shape within the space of the outside member, can be made thinner as a whole.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Hence, the variable capacitance type capacitor according to the present invention can be easily housed in a thin type casing such as that of a position indicator or the like, and can be readily put into mass production.</p><heading id="h0009">[Effect of the Invention]</heading><p id="p0015" num="0015">According to the present invention, it is possible to realize a variable capacitance type capacitor that can be handled as one device, has a simple construction capable of being made thinner, and has a capacitance corresponding to an externally applied force. Hence, the variable capacitance type capacitor according to the present invention is suitable as a part to be housed in a thin type casing such as that of a position indicator or the like, and can be easily used as a mass-produced part.</p><heading id="h0010">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0016" num="0016"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is

(polyethylene<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> terephthalate) and the like. The outside member 1 has a hollow cylindrical shape whose outside diameter R1 is for example 3 to 5 mm and whose inside diameter R2 is 2 to 4 mm. In the present example, the outside member 1 is formed of ceramic, and has an opening having the inside diameter R2 at both ends of the outside member 1 in the direction of the central axis of the outside member 1.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The inside member 2 is formed of a dielectric material made of resin such as PET, for example. The inside member 2 has a column-shaped part 21 whose diameter R is slightly smaller than the inside diameter R2 of the outside member 1 (R &lt; R2). The inside member 2 in the present example also has a ring-shaped projecting part (hereinafter referred to as a flange part) 22 that projects radially outward from the peripheral surface (column surface) of the column-shaped part 21 on one end surface side in the direction of the central axis of the column-shaped part 21.

When the inside member 2 is pressed by a pressing member and the inside member 2 is displaced by a distance z in the direction of the central axis of the inside member 2, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0015">FIG. 21C</figref>, the dielectric 27 is displaced by the distance z in the direction of the central axis of the inside member 2 with respect to the outside conductor pattern 11.</p><p id="p0184" num="0184">Then, the area of the dielectric 27 opposed to the outside conductor pattern 11 changes between the outside conductor pattern 11 and the conductor 230 on the column-shaped part 21 of the inside member 2.

The dielectric constant εB' is a value corresponding to the displacement z corresponding to an external force of the pressing member. The capacitance CB of the variable capacitance type capacitor 10B in the present example is therefore a value corresponding to the external force of the pressing member.</p><p id="p0186" num="0186">In the example of <figref idrefs="f0015">FIGS. 21A to 21C</figref>, the outside conductor pattern 11 formed in the outer circumferential surface 1d of the outside member 1 is formed within the depression parts If. Thus, the outside conductor pattern 11 is closer to the circumferential surface of the inside member<!-- EPO <DP n="47"> --> 2, and the capacitance CB of the variable capacitance type capacitor 10B in the present example is correspondingly increased.</p><p id="p0187" num="0187">In the above-described example of <figref idrefs="f0015">FIGS. 21A to 21C</figref>, the dielectric 27, further formed on the conductor 230 formed on the column-shaped part 21 of the inside member 2, is formed so as to be opposed to the outside conductor pattern 11 formed on the outer circumferential surface 1d of the outside member 1. However, as with the inside conductor pattern 23 in the foregoing embodiments, the dielectric 27 may be formed so as not to be opposed to the outside conductor pattern 11 in a state of no external force being applied by the pressing member. In that case, however, the capacitance CB of the variable capacitance type capacitor 10B changes in a different manner than in the above example.</p><p id="p0188" num="0188">Next, in the foregoing embodiments, the pressing of the inside member by the pressing member displaces the position in the direction of the central axis of the inside member with respect to the outside member.

In addition, the hollow part of the outside member may be a prismatic shape rather than a cylindrical shape.</p><p id="p0190" num="0190">In addition, the inside member housed in the space of the hollow part of the outside member may have a prismatic shape rather than a cylindrical shape. The columnar shape of the hollow part of the outside member and the columnar shape of the inside member do not need to be shapes corresponding to each other. One of the outside member and the inside member may have a cylindrical shape, and the other may have a prismatic shape, or the outside member and the inside member may have prismatic shapes different from each other, as long as the inside member is housed in the outside member. Hence, a distance between the circumferential surface (column surface) of the column body part of the inside member and the inner circumferential surface of the hollow part of the outside member may not be constant in the circumferential direction. That is, the position of the central axis of the hollow part of the outside member and the position of the central axis of the inside member do not necessarily need to coincide with each other. In short, it suffices to<!-- EPO <DP n="48"> --> obtain a change in the capacitance exhibiting a predetermined change characteristic, which corresponds to an external force when the external force displaces the inside member relative to the outside member in the direction of the central axis.</p><p id="p0191" num="0191">In the foregoing embodiments, the area in which the outside conductor pattern and the inside conductor pattern are opposed to each other is zero when no external force is applied, and is increased according to an external force when the external force is applied. However, the outside conductor pattern and the inside conductor pattern may of course be partially opposed to each other even when no external force is applied.</p><p id="p0192" num="0192">In addition, the outside conductor pattern and the inside conductor pattern may have shapes substantially identical or similar to each other, and the area in which the outside conductor pattern and the inside conductor pattern are opposed to each other may be maximized when no external force is applied. When an external force is applied, the area in which the outside conductor pattern and the inside conductor pattern are opposed to each other may be decreased according to the external force.</p><p id="p0193" num="0193">The above description has been made by taking a position indicator as an example of an electronic device, in which a variable capacitance type capacitor according to the present invention is used.
