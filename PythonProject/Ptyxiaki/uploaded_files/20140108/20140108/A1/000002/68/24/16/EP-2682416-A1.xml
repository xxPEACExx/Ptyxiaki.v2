producing a polyamide resin.</p><heading id="h0002">Background Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Polyamide resins produced from a diamine and a dicarboxylic acid as a starting material are widely used in various fields. As a method for producing such a polyamide resin, common is a method in which first a nylon salt (polyamide salt) is prepared by using a diamine and a dicarboxylic acid, and the resulting nylon salt is polymerized under pressurized conditions.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">However, when a nylon salt is polymerized under pressurized conditions to produce a polyamide resin, it takes a relatively long time for a practical molecular weight to be achieved. Consequently, a triamine, a by-product, is produced in the polyamide resin, to be a cause for gelation. Further, when the nylon salt is polymerized under pressurized conditions, the apparatus used for the polymerization is required to be of a pressurization type. Accordingly, disadvantageously the introduction of a pressurization-type apparatus, and the operation and maintenance of the apparatus increase the costs involved.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">For the purpose of solving such a problem as described above, the polymerization of the nylon salt under normal pressure has been investigated. For example,<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> JPH03-243623A describes a preparation of a polyamide resin by polymerizing under normal pressure a nylon salt obtained from equimolar amounts of 1,12-diaminododecane and a dicarboxylic acid.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">However, the production method of JPH03-243623A is a production method restricted to the polymerization of the nylon salt prepared from a dicarboxylic acid and 1,12-diaminododecane, and is a technique feasible because of the boiling point of 1,12-diaminododecane as high as 304°C. On the contrary, when a nylon salt obtained from a dicarboxylic acid and a diamine having a boiling point of 300°C or lower is polymerized by the technique described in JPH03-243623A, the diamine is volatilized from the reaction system, and the molar balance between the diamine and the dicarboxylic acid included in the nylon salt is lost. Consequently, the obtained polyamide resin does not attain the achievement of a high molecular weight, and is unsuitable for practical use.</p><heading id="h0003">Summary of Invention</heading><heading id="h0004">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">In view of such a problem as described above, the problem to be solved by the present invention is to provide a method capable of producing a polyamide resin, being reduced in the occurrence of by-products and having a high molecular weight.</p><heading id="h0005">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">The present inventors made a diligent study for the purpose of solving such a problem to be solved. Consequently, the present inventors have reached the present invention by discovering that by polymerizing a<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> nylon salt while the nylon salt is heated under normal pressure while water vapor is being allowed to be present in the polymerization reaction system and simultaneously water is being distilled outside the reaction system, the polymerization time is reduced to reduce by-products, and additionally a polyamide resin having a high molecular weight is obtained.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Specifically, the gist of the present invention is as follows.
<ol><li>(1) A method for producing a polyamide resin wherein a nylon salt obtained from a dicarboxylic acid and a diamine having a boiling point exceeding 100°C is heated under normal pressure while water vapor is being allowed to be present in the reaction system.</li><li>(2) The method for producing a polyamide resin according to (1), wherein at the start of the heating, 0.5 to 10 parts by mass of water in relation to 100 parts by mass of the nylon salt is allowed to be present beforehand in the reaction system.</li><li>(3) The method for producing a polyamide resin according to (1), wherein at the start of the heating, water vapor is made to flow in the reaction system.</li><li>(4) The method for producing a polyamide resin according to any one of (1) to (3), wherein as the diamine, at least one selected from 1,10-diaminodecane, 1,11-diaminoundecane and 1,12-diaminododecane is used.</li><li>(5) The method for producing a polyamide resin according to any one of (1) to (4), wherein during the heating, the diamine is not distilled outside the reaction system.</li><li>(6) The method for producing a polyamide resin according to any one of claims (1) to (5), wherein water is distilled outside the reaction system while water is being refluxed into the reaction system.</li></ol><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><heading id="h0006">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">According to the production method of the present invention, as compared to the case where the nylon salt is polymerized under pressurized conditions, the polymerization time is reduced by polymerizing the nylon salt under normal pressure, and a polyamide resin having a smaller amount of the triamine, a by-product, namely, a polyamide resin suppressed in gelation can be obtained. Additionally, because of performing the polymerization under normal pressure, no pressurization-type apparatus is required, and the cost for the introduction of a pressurization-type apparatus and the cost for the operation and maintenance of the apparatus are reduced.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Yet additionally, because of performing the polymerization by using a diamine having a boiling point exceeding 100°C while water vapor is being allowed to be present in the reaction system, the distillation of the diamine included in the nylon salt outside the reaction system during the polymerization reaction can be suppressed. Consequently, the molar balance between the dicarboxylic acid and the diamine included in the nylon salt can be maintained, and hence a polyamide resin having a high molecular weight can be obtained.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Also, in the case where the polymerization is performed while water is being distilled outside the reaction system while water is being refluxed into the reaction system, the reaction decomposing the produced polyamide resin to produce the dicarboxylic acid and the diamine can be more suppressed, and hence the polymerization reaction to produce the polyamide resin can be further promoted.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><heading id="h0007">Description of Embodiments</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">Hereinafter, the present invention is described in detail. In the method for producing a polyamide resin of the present invention, a nylon salt obtained from a dicarboxylic acid and a diamine having a boiling point exceeding 100°C is heated under normal pressure while water vapor is being allowed to be present in the reaction system.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Examples of the dicarboxylic acid for obtaining the nylon salt used in the production method of the present invention include aliphatic dicarboxylic acids, alicyclic dicarboxylic acids and aromatic dicarboxylic acids. Examples of the aliphatic dicarboxylic acid include: oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, pimelic acid, suberic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, undecanedioic acid and dodecanedioic acid. Examples of the alicyclic dicarboxylic acid include cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid. Examples of the aromatic dicarboxylic acid include phthalic acid, terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid and naphthalenedicarboxylic acid. Among these, from the viewpoint of versatility, terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid and adipic acid are preferable as the dicarboxylic acid.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In the nylon salt, the proportion of the total amount of terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid and adipic acid in relation to the total amount of the dicarboxylic acid component is preferably 70 mol% or more and more preferably 90 mol% or more.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The diamine for obtaining the nylon salt used in the production method of the present invention is required to<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> be a diamine having a boiling point exceeding 100°C, is preferably a diamine having a boiling point exceeding 150°C and is more preferably a diamine having a boiling point exceeding 200°C. The use of the diamine having a boiling point exceeding 100°C precludes, during the reaction to polymerize the nylon salt, the distillation of the diamine outside the reaction system as a result of the volatilization of the diamine in preference to water, and also precludes the loss of the molar balance between the dicarboxylic acid and the diamine. Consequently, the polyamide resin allowed to achieve a high molecular weight can be obtained. The larger the difference in boiling point between water and the diamine (namely, the higher the boiling point of the diamine), the more the distillation of only the diamine outside the reaction system is suppressed, and hence only water can be easily distilled outside the reaction system.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Examples of the diamine having a boiling point exceeding 100°C include the following: 1,2-diaminoethane (boiling point: 117°C), 1,3-diaminopropane (boiling point: 140°C), 1,4-diaminobutane (boiling point: 159°C), 1,5-diaminopentane (boiling point: 179°C), 1,6-diaminohexane (boiling point: 204°C), 1,7-diaminoheptane (boiling point: 224°C), 1,8-diaminooctane (boiling point: 240°C), 1,9-diaminononane (boiling point: 258°C), 1,10-diaminodecane (boiling point: 271°C), 1,11-diaminoundecane (boiling point: 282°C), 1,12-diaminododecane (boiling point: 304°C), 1,4-cyclohexanediamine (boiling point: 197°C), o-phenylenediamine (boiling point: 284°C), m-phenylenediamine (boiling point: 283°C), p-phenylenediamine (boiling point: 267°C), p-xylylenediamine (boiling point: 262°C) and m-xylylenediamine (boiling point: 248°C). Among these, from the viewpoint of increasing the difference in boiling point between water<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> and the diamine, 1,10-diaminodecane, 1,11-diaminoundecane and 1,12-diaminododecane are preferable.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Examples of the polyamide resin obtained by combining such monomers (a dicarboxylic acid and a diamine) as described above include polyamide 6T, polyamide 9T, polyamide 10T, polyamide 6I, polyamide 9I, polyamide 10I, polyamide 46, polyamide 66 and polyamide 610.

From the viewpoint of maintaining the condition of being in powder form of the dicarboxylic acid, the reaction time in the solid method is preferably set at 0 to 6 hours and more preferably set at 0.25 to 3 hours from the completion of the addition of the diamine.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The method for adding the diamine in the solid method is not particularly limited as long as the addition method allows the dicarboxylic acid to maintain the condition of being in powder form. Among the addition methods, from the viewpoint of suppressing the agglomeration of the obtained nylon salt and thus efficiently performing the formation reaction of the nylon salt while the dicarboxylic acid is maintaining the condition of being in powder form, for example, the following methods are preferable: a method in which the diamine is continuously added by using, for example, a feeder, or a method in which the diamine is intermittently added (a method repeating the addition<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> periodically) in a divided manner in an appropriate amount at a time (for example, at a time, in 1/10 to 1/100 the total amount of the diamine to be added). Alternatively, a method based on a combination of the foregoing methods may also be adopted. The feeder is also not particularly limited, and heretofore known feeders can be used.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In the method for producing a polyamide resin of the present invention, such a nylon salt as described above is required to be heated under normal pressure while water vapor is being allowed to be present in the reaction system. Because the boiling point of the diamine included in the nylon salt is 100°C or higher, when the reaction system is heated, water is gasified in preference to the diamine, and the diamine is not distilled outside the reaction system. The presence of water vapor in the reaction system allows the volatilized diamine to be refluxed with water vapor, and hence the diamine is not distilled outside the reaction system. Consequently, the molar balance between the dicarboxylic acid and the diamine included in the nylon salt is not lost, and thus the nylon salt is allowed to easily achieve a high molecular weight. "Normal pressure" as referred to herein means that the pressure inside the reaction vessel is substantially the same as the atmospheric pressure in the environment where the reaction vessel is placed, and specifically means that [(atmospheric pressure) - (pressure inside reaction vessel)] is approximately ±0.01 MPa.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Examples of the method for allowing water vapor to be present in the reaction system include the following methods: a method in which water vapor is allowed to be present, for example, by beforehand adding water to the<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> reaction vessel in advance of the heating; and a method in which water vapor is directly made to flow in the reaction system from before the start of the heating. These methods may also be used in combination. The adoption of these methods enables water vapor to be present in the reaction system from immediately after the start of the heating, and accordingly, when the nylon salt is heated, the distillation of the diamine isolated from the nylon salt outside the reaction system can be suppressed, and hence a polyamide resin having a high molecular weight can be produced. The occurrence or nonoccurrence of the distillation of the diamine outside the reaction system can be verified by comparing the molar ratios between the dicarboxylic acid and the diamine in the obtained polyamide resin. In the present invention, when the foregoing molar ratio in the polyamide resin is 50/50 to 55/45, it is taken that the molar balance is maintained.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In the case where water is beforehand added to the reaction vessel in advance of the heating, the addition amount of water is preferably set at 0.5 to 10 parts by mass and more preferably set at 0.5 to 5 parts by mass in relation to 100 parts by mass of the nylon salt. The addition amount of water set so as to fall within a range from 0.5 to 10 parts by mass enables the suppression of the by-production of triamine while the volatilization of the diamine is being efficiently suppressed. When the addition amount of water is less than 0.5 part by mass, immediately after the heating, the amount of water vapor in the reaction system is small and accordingly the diamine is sometimes distilled outside the reaction system. On the other hand, when the addition amount of water exceeds 10 parts by mass, the nylon salt partially<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> dissolved in water and the triamine tends to be by-produced when the nylon salt is polymerized.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">In the case where water vapor is made to flow directly in the reaction system from before the start of the heating, the flow rate of water vapor is different depending on the inner capacity of the reaction vessel; for example, when the inner capacity is about 30 L, the flow rate of water vapor is preferably set at 0.2 to 1.0 g/min and more preferably 0.3 to 0.8 g/min.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In the production method of the present invention, water is produced as the polymerization proceeds, and the produced amount of water is increased or decreased depending on the progress of the polymerization reaction. In the present invention, in the first half of the polymerization being high in the possibility of the volatilization of the diamine, the molar fraction of water vapor in the atmosphere inside the reaction vessel is preferably set at 10% or more and more preferably 20 to 90%. Here, the first half of the polymerization means the time range where the terminal reaction percentage is approximately 85% or less. The molar fraction of water vapor is, as described later, derived from the molar quantity of water and the molar quantity of the inert gas distilled per unit time. By setting the molar fraction of water vapor at 10% or more, even when the diamine is gasified in the reaction system, the diamine is refluxed together with water, and hence without distilling the diamine outside the reaction system, only water can be distilled outside the reaction system. On the other hand, in the case where no inert gas is introduced, the proportion of water vapor becomes 100%, but when the distillation amount of water is decreased as the<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> polymerization proceeds, there is a possibility that external air is mixed in the reaction system.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">For the purpose of controlling the molar fraction of water vapor in the reaction vessel so as to fall within the foregoing range, the water produced by the polymerization reaction is preferably partially distilled outside the reaction system while water is being refluxed. In the case where no refluxing is performed, even when water is beforehand added to the reaction vessel in advance of the heating, the water vapor in the reaction vessel is completely distilled depending on the size of the reaction vessel or the flow rate of the inert gas, sometimes substantially no water vapor is present in the reaction vessel at the start of the polymerization, and in such a case, the distillation of the diamine cannot be suppressed. For the purpose of distilling a fraction of water outside the reaction system while water is being refluxed, for example, the reaction vessel may be provided with a reflux apparatus such as a reflux tube or a reflux tower. In such a case, for example, the length, the cross section or the temperature of the reflux apparatus can be appropriately selected.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">For example, the length of the reflux apparatus, the cross-sectional shape of the reflux apparatus and the temperature of the reflux apparatus in the present invention are not particularly limited, and can be appropriately selected from the optional ones.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The polymerization temperature is preferably set at 180 to 320°C and more preferably set at 200 to 270°C. The polymerization temperature set at 180 to 320°C enables the efficient progress of the polymerization reaction while the side reaction producing the by-product such as<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> triamine and the degradation of the polymer are being suppressed. Specifically, when the polymerization temperature is lower than 180°C, the polymerization rate sometimes becomes too slow. On the other hand, when the polymerization temperature exceeds 320°C, the effects of the side reaction are developed to increase the amount of the triamine and to result in a polyamide resin, for example, abundant in gel.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The polymerization time is preferably set at 0.5 to 72 hours and more preferably set at 1 to 36 hours. When the polymerization time is less than 0.5 hour, the polymerization reaction sometimes becomes insufficient. On the other hand, when the polymerization time exceeds 72 hours, the amount of the triamine, a by-product, is increased as described above, and a polyamide resin, for example, abundant in gel is sometimes obtained.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">In the production method of the present invention, as described above, water is distilled outside the reaction system from the start to the end of the polymerization. Herewith, the hydrolysis reaction of the produced polyamide resin is suppressed, and the production of the polyamide resin is promoted. Consequently, the polymerization time is reduced, the amount of the triamine, a by-product, is suppressed in the obtained polyamide resin, and the occurrence of, for example, gel can be suppressed. More specifically, the polyamide resin obtained by the production method of the present invention allows the amount of the triamine in the polyamide resin to be as small as 0.3 mol% or less in relation to the amount of the diamine.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">In the production method of the present invention, for the purpose of preventing the degradation of the<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> contents in the reaction vessel due to the mixing of the oxygen outside the reaction system, it is preferable to make an inert gas to flow in the reaction vessel.

In such a case, the flow rate of the inert gas in the reaction vessel may be changed over to 0.01 to 10 L/min.

In Tables 1 and 2, the addition amounts of water represent the proportions of water in relation to 100 parts by mass of the nylon salt, and the abbreviations represent the following.

Accordingly, in any of Examples 1 to 12, as compared to Comparative Example 1 where the polymerization was performed under pressurized conditions, the polymerization time was shorter and the amount of the triamine was smaller.</p><p id="p0089" num="0089">In each of Examples 1 and 2, the molar ratio between the dicarboxylic acid and the diamine was 50/50 both in the starting material such as the nylon salt and in the obtained polyamide resin, and hence it is concluded that the diamine was not substantially distilled outside the reaction system.</p><p id="p0090" num="0090">In each of Examples 2, 3 and 8, the polymerization between terephthalic acid and 1,10-diaminodecane was performed by beforehand adding 0.5 to 10 parts by mass of water, in advance of the polymerization, in the reaction vessel in relation to 100 parts by mass of the nylon salt. Accordingly, from the start of the polymerization, the reaction vessel was in a condition of being sufficiently<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --> filled with water vapor. Consequently, the polyamide resin obtained in each of Examples 2, 3 and 8 was higher in relative viscosity than the polyamide resin obtained in each of Examples 4 and 5 smaller in the addition amount of water than the amount specified in the present invention. Additionally, the polyamide resin obtained in each of Examples 2, 3 and 8 was smaller in the amount of the triamine than the polyamide resin obtained in Example 6 larger in the addition amount of water than the amount specified in the present invention.</p><p id="p0091" num="0091">In Example 9, the polymerization was performed by making water vapor flow directly in the reaction system from before the start of the heating. Accordingly, from the start of the polymerization, the reaction vessel was in a condition of being sufficiently filled with water vapor. Consequently, the obtained polyamide resin was higher in relative viscosity and smaller in the amount of the triamine.</p><p id="p0092" num="0092">In Comparative Example 1, a polyamide resin was polymerized under pressurized conditions. Accordingly, the polymerization time was longer and the amount of the triamine in the obtained polyamide resin was larger in Comparative Example 1 than in Example 1.</p><p id="p0093" num="0093">In Comparative Example 2, water was not refluxed into the polymerization reaction system, hence water vapor was wholly distilled outside the polymerization reaction system, thus no water vapor was present in the reaction system at the start of the polymerization, and hence the diamine was partially distilled outside the reaction system. Consequently, in the obtained polyamide resin, no high molecular weight was achieved and the relative viscosity was low.<!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --></p><p id="p0094" num="0094">In Comparative Example 3, the polymerization was performed without adding any water and additionally without refluxing water into the polymerization reaction system, hence the amount of water vapor in the reaction system at the start of the polymerization was small, and the diamine was partially distilled outside the reaction system. Consequently, in the obtained polyamide resin, no high molecular weight was achieved and the relative viscosity was low.</p><heading id="h0040">Industrial Applicability</heading><p id="p0095" num="0095">The method for producing a polyamide resin of the present invention performs the polymerization under normal pressure, accordingly reduces the polymerization time as compared to the case where the polymerization is performed under pressurized conditions, and makes it possible to obtain a polyamide resin being small in the amount of the triamine to be a cause for gelation and having a high molecular weight. The production method of the present invention also requires no pressurization device, accordingly the costs for the introduction and the operation and maintenance of the apparatus are low, and hence is extremely useful.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56983167" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A method for producing a polyamide resin wherein a nylon salt obtained from a dicarboxylic acid and a diamine having a boiling point exceeding 100°C is heated under normal pressure while water vapor is being allowed to be present in a reaction system.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0002" num="0002"><claim-text>The method for producing a polyamide resin according to claim 1, wherein at a start of a heating, 0.5 to 10 parts by mass of water in relation to 100 parts by mass of the nylon salt is allowed to be present beforehand in the reaction system.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0003" num="0003"><claim-text>The method for producing a polyamide resin according to claim 1, wherein at the start of the heating, water vapor is made to flow in the reaction system.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0004" num="0004"><claim-text>The method for producing a polyamide resin according to any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein as the diamine, at least one selected from 1,10-diaminodecane, 1,11-diaminoundecane and 1,12-diaminododecane is used.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0005" num="0005"><claim-text>The method for producing a polyamide resin according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein during the heating, the diamine is not distilled outside the reaction system.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-0006" num="0006"><claim-text>The method for producing a polyamide resin according to any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein water is distilled outside the reaction system while water is being refluxed into the reaction system.</claim-text></claim></claims><search-report-data><doc-page id="srep0001" file="srep0001.tif" wi="165" he="232" type="tif"/><doc-page id="srep0002" file="srep0002.tif" wi="165" he="233" type="tif"/></search-report-data><copyright>User acknowledges that Fairview Research LLC and its third party providers retain all right, title and interest in and to this xml under applicable copyright laws.
