For example, in Patent Literature 1 an information sending and receiving system for displaying product categories such as "home appliances", "books" and "computer" on pages listing products is disclosed. A user can easily narrow down products by selecting a category of products they are interested in purchasing from among these categories.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">On the other hand, enormous cost is incurred in systematically building and maintaining peculiar expressions such as people's names, place names or product names. Consequently, much research has been conducted on automatic acquisition methods for automatically acquiring by computer the semantic relationship of peculiar expressions. For example, in Non-Patent Literature 1, an algorithm (called the "g-Espresso algorithm") is disclosed for extracting semantic categories from sentences with words separated by spaces. In addition, in Non-Patent Literature 2, an algorithm (called the "g-Monaka algorithm") is disclosed for extracting semantic categories from sentences in which words are not separated by spaces.</p><heading id="h0003">Prior Art Literature</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004"><ul><li>Patent Literature 1: Unexamined Japanese Patent Application Kokai Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2009048226A"><text>2009-48226</text></patcit></li></ul><!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><heading id="h0005">Non-Patent Literature</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005"><ul><li>Non-Patent Literature 1: <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Mamoru Komachi, Taku Kudo, Masahi Shimbo, and Yuji Matsumoto, "Graph-based analysis of semantic drift in espresso-like bootstrapping algorithms."

However, to the store it is an onerous burden to survey categories in which new products should be registered each time a new product appears, making it desirable to automatically select candidates of category in which such should be registered.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In consideration of the foregoing, it is an object of the present invention to provide a set expansion processing device, set expansion processing method, program and non-transitory recording medium well suited to selecting candidates for terms belonging to the same category semantically.</p><heading id="h0008">Means for Solving the Problems</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">The set expansion processing device according to a first aspect of the present invention comprises:

Furthermore, the segment acquisition unit 103 excludes redundant strings out of the divided strings, and obtains the remaining strings as segments.

In addition, the method of obtaining the segments is not limited to a method of obtaining segments using segment partition strings.

In other words, segments containing normal text in general tend to have lengths of segment components contained in that segment that are not as uniform as those of segments not containing normal text. Furthermore, segments containing normal text often do not contain instances belonging to the same contextual range as the seed string, and thus are not suitable as segments for obtaining instance candidates.

Below, the set expansion device 100 ranks instance candidates from similarity computed based on the g-Monaka algorithm, and extracts as instances those having a similarity at least as great as a threshold value. The method of finding the similarity is not limited to the g-Monaka algorithm. For example, the g-Espresso algorithm may be used.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">The extraction unit 108 generates a connection graph of the n-gram containing the extracted instance candidates, from snippets obtained through searches using the instance candidates. Furthermore, the extraction unit 108 computes the similarity between the received seed string and that instance based on the context before and after the seed string and the context before and after the instance candidate in that connection graph, and extracts an instance that should be contained in an expanded set<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> that is an expansion of the set including those seed string, from those instance candidates, based on that similarity. Below, the method of computing the similarity based on the g-Monaka algorithm is explained in detail.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">The extraction unit 108 obtains a list of the top 300 snippets in the search results by inputting the respective instance candidates selected by the selection unit 107 as queries in the Web page's search engine.

In addition, when the percentage of Japanese characters is extremely low and there are numerous symbols, the snippet is excluded as inappropriate.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">Next, the extraction unit 108 builds a connection matrix M(u,v) for all text n-grams contained in the remaining snippet set.

An example of the generated connection graph G<sub>M</sub> is shown in <figref idrefs="f0011">FIG. 11</figref>.

A bibliographic coupling means that documents x and y cite the same document. That is to say, the bibliographic coupling can be thought of as corresponding to whether or not the n-gram u and the n-gram v are connected to the same n-gram. On the other hand, whether or not the left-side context of the n-gram u and the left-side context of the n-gram v are similar can be thought of as corresponding to the concept of co-citation of the citation analysis method. Co-citation means that documents x and y are cited by the same document.

The right-side context similarity matrix A<sub>R</sub> and the left-side context similarity matrix A<sub>L</sub> can be expressed by an equation (Formula 3) using the connection matrix M. <maths id="math0003" num="[Formula 3]"><math display="block"><msub><mi>A</mi><mi>R</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mn>1</mn><msup><mfenced open="|" close="|"><mi>V</mi></mfenced><mn>2</mn></msup></mfrac><mo>⁢</mo><msup><mi mathvariant="italic">MM</mi><mi>T</mi></msup><mo>,</mo><mspace width="2em"/><msub><mi>A</mi><mi>L</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mn>1</mn><msup><mfenced open="|" close="|"><mi>V</mi></mfenced><mn>2</mn></msup></mfrac><mo>⁢</mo><msup><mi mathvariant="italic">M</mi><mi>T</mi></msup><mo>⁢</mo><mi>M</mi></math><img id="ib0003" file="imgb0003.tif" wi="165" he="45" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths></p><p id="p0081" num="0081">The extraction unit 108 finds the right-side context similarity matrix A<sub>R</sub> and the left-side context similarity matrix A<sub>L</sub> for all of the n-grams.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">In addition, in order to consider the n-gram u and the n-gram v to be semantically similar, it is necessary for both the right-side context and the left-side context to be similar (hereafter called the "dual-side adjacency constraint").
