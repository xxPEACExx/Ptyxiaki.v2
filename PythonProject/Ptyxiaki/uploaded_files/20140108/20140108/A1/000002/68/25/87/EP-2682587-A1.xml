These systems have been successful and, in some cases, produce emission levels that are at the lower limits of measurement capabilities, approximately 1 to 3 parts per million (ppm) of NOx and CO. Although these systems are a great benefit from a standpoint of emission production, the operational envelope of the systems is substantially reduced when compared to more conventional combustion systems. As a consequence, the control of fuel conditions, distribution and injection into the combustion zones has become a critical operating parameter and requires frequent adjustment, when ambient atmospheric conditions, such as temperature, humidity and pressure, change. The re-adjustment of the combustion fuel conditions, distribution and injection is termed tuning.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Controlled operation of a combustion system generally employs a manual setting of the operational control settings of a combustor to yield an average operational condition. These settings may be input through a controller, which as used herein shall mean any device used to control the operation of a system. Examples include a Distributed Control System (DCS), a gas turbine controller, a programmable logical controller (PLC), a stand-alone computer with communication to another controller and/or directly to a system.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">These settings are satisfactory at the time of the setup, but conditions may change when tuning issues arise and cause an unacceptable operation in a matter of hours or days. Tuning issues are any situation whereby any operational parameters of a system are in excess of acceptable limits. Examples include emissions excursion outside of allowable limits, combustor dynamics excursion outside of allowable limits, or any other tuning event requiring adjustment of a turbine's operational control elements. Other approaches use a formula to predict emissions based on a gas turbine's operating settings and select a set point for fuel distribution and/or<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> overall machine fuel/air ratio, without modifying other control elements, such as fuel gas temperature. These approaches do not allow for timely variation, do not take advantage of actual dynamics and emission data or do not modify fuel distribution, fuel temperature and/or other turbine operating parameters.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Another variable that impacts the lean premixed combustion system is fuel composition. Sufficient variation in fuel composition will cause a change in the heat release of the lean premixed combustion system. Such change may lead to emissions excursions, unstable combustion processes, or even blow out of the combustion system.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Mis-operation of the combustion system manifests itself in augmented pressure pulsations or an increase in combustion dynamics (hereinafter, combustion dynamics may be indicated by the symbol "δP"). Pulsations can have sufficient force to destroy the combustion system and dramatically reduce the life of combustion hardware. Additionally, improper tuning of the combustion system can lead to emission excursions and violate emission permits. Therefore, a means to maintain the stability of the lean premixed combustion systems, on a regular or periodic basis, within the proper operating envelope, is of great value and interest to the industry. Additionally, a system that operates by utilizing near real-time data, taken from the turbine sensors, would have significant value to coordinate modulation of operational control elements such as fuel distribution, fuel gas inlet temperature and/or overall machine fuel/air ratio.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">While real-time tuning of a combustion system can provide tremendous operational flexibility and protection for turbine hardware, a combustion system may concurrently experience a number of different operational issues. For example, most turbine operators of lean premixed combustion systems are concerned with exhaust emissions (NOx and CO) as well as combustor dynamics. It is not uncommon for both high NOx emissions and high combustor dynamics to coexist on a turbine. Additionally, tuning in response to one concern can make other constraints worse, for example tuning for low NOx can make combustor dynamics worse, tuning for high CO can make NOx worse, etc. It would be beneficial to provide a system whereby an algorithm is used to compare the current status of all tuning concerns, rank each concern in order of importance, determine the operational concern of most interest, and subsequently commence automated tuning to remediate this dominant operational concern.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>Summary of the Disclosure</b></heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">The present disclosure provides a tuning system for tuning the operation of a gas turbine.

The turbine has turbine controls for controlling various operational elements of the turbine. The method includes the steps of receiving operational data about the turbine, providing a hierarchy of tuning issues and determining whether sensed operational data is within predetermined operational limits and producing one or more indicators. If said operational data is not within predetermined operational limits, the tuning controller ranks the one or more indicators to determine dominant tuning concern; and tunes the operation of the turbine based on dominant tuning concern.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The present disclosure further provides a computer readable medium having embodied therein a computer program for tuning the operation of a combustion turbine. The computer readable medium comprises code segments for receiving operational data for the turbine, providing a hierarchy of tuning issues, determining whether sensed operational data is within predetermined operational limits and producing one or more indicators if said operational data is not within predetermined operational limits.

The operational parameters of the turbine which are received by the controller may include one or more of the following: combustor dynamics, turbine exhaust temperature and turbine exhaust emissions. The operational control elements include one of more of the following: fuel distribution, fuel temperature and fuel air ratio. A communication link may be provided between the tuning controller, gas turbine controller and a main power plant control system. This link permits communication with the turbine's sensors and the operational controls from devices outside of the turbine system.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The controller operates by receiving data from the sensors. Operational priorities for the turbine may be set within the controller and are typically selected from optimum NOx emissions, optimum power output and/or optimum combustor dynamics. The data received from the turbine sensors is compared to stored operational standards within the controller. The selected operational standards are preferably based on the set operational priorities. A determination is made as to whether the turbine operation conforms to the operational standards. In addition, upon the data being determined to be out of conformance, a further determination is made of the dominant tuning concern. This further determination is preferably based on the preset operational priorities. Once the logical determinations are made, the tuning controller communicates with the operational control means to perform a selected adjustment of an operational control element of the turbine. The selected adjustment is preferably based on the dominant tuning concern and has a preset fixed incremental value and defined value range. Each incremental change is preferably input over a set period of time, which is sufficient for the turbine to gain operational stability, once an adjustment is made. Once the time period passes, operational data is again received from the turbine sensor means to determine if an additional incremental change to an operational control element is desired. Upon completing the adjustments within a defined range, a further operational control element is adjusted, again preferably based on the dominant tuning concern, and a further fixed incremental adjustment is made. The tuning process continues by the controller receiving operational data to determine if the operation is conforming to the operational standards or whether an additional adjustment is required.

In the depicted embodiments, the systems and methods relate to automatic tuning of combustion turbines, such as those used for power generation. Persons of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the teachings herein can be readily adapted to other types of combustion turbines. Accordingly, the terms used herein are not intended to be limiting of the embodiments of the present invention. Instead, it will be understood that the embodiments of the present disclosure relate generally to the field of combustion turbines, and in particular for systems, methods and computer readable media for tuning of combustion turbines.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041"><figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> shows a communication diagram for a gas turbine engine (not shown), within which a tuning controller 10 of the present disclosure operates. As shown, a communication link, such as a Distributed Control System (DCS) is identified by the numeral 20, and provides a link to the various elements of the system. However, the operational elements of the turbine may be linked directly to each other, without the need for a DCS. As shown, turbine controller 30 communicates directly with the gas turbine (not shown) and with other elements of the system, such as the tuning controller 10, either directly or through the DCS 20. In the present disclosure, information relevant to turbine operation is directed through the to the tuning controller 10. This relevant information is also referred to as the turbine's operational parameters, which are parameters that are measured, by way of various types and number of sensors, to indicate the operational status of various aspects of the gas turbine. These parameters can be fed as inputs into the autotuning controller. Examples of operational parameters include combustor dynamics, turbine exhaust emissions, and turbine exhaust temperature (which is generally influenced by the overall fuel/air ratio of the turbine).</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Referring now to <figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref>, the tuning controller 10 is contemplated to be a stand-alone computer, such as a PC, operating to run as a programmable logical controller (PLC), using a form of computer readable media. The tuning controller 10 is preferably a separate computer from the turbine controller 30 that is in constant communication from with the turbine controller 30. Signals from the tuning controller 10 may also be transferred to the turbine controller 30 or other controls within the system by the use of an external control device, such as a MODBUS Serial or Ethernet communication protocol port existing on or added to the system.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The relevant operational parameters are received from sensor means associated with the turbine. For example, the turbine exhaust emission reading is taken from stack emissions by a continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) 40, and sent to the tuning controller 10 and/or the turbine controller 30. Combustion dynamics are sensed using a dynamic pressure<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> sensing probe located within the combustion region of the turbine combustor. As shown, a continuous dynamics monitoring system (CDMS) 50 is provided and communicates with the tuning controller 10 and turbine controller 30. The CDMS 50 preferably uses either direct mounted or wave guide connected pressure or light sensing probes to measure the combustion dynamics. Another relevant operational parameter is the fuel gas temperature, which is sensed at the fuel heating controller 60. The fuel temperature information is directed to the tuning controller 10 and turbine controller 30 from the fuel heating controller 60. Since part of the tuning operation may include adjustment of the fuel temperature, there may be a two-way communication between the tuning controller 10 and/or turbine controller 30 and the fuel heating unit 60.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Relevant operational data from the turbine is collected at least several times per minute. This data collection allows for near real-time system tuning. Most relevant turbine operational data is collected by the tuning controller 10 in near real-time. However, the turbine exhaust emissions is typically received from the CEMS 40 by the tuning controller 10 with a lag time of up to 2 to 8 minutes from current operating conditions. This time lag necessitates the need for the tuning controller 10 to receive and buffer relevant information, for a similar time lag, before making operational tuning adjustments. The tuning controller 10 tuning adjustment time lag assures that all of the operational (including exhaust emissions) data is representative of a stable turbine operation before and after any adjustments are made. Once the data is deemed stable, the tuning controller 10 determines whether there is a need for adjustment of operational control elements to bring the tuning parameters into acceptable ranges. If no adjustment is necessary, the tuning controller 10 maintains the current tuning and waits to receive the next data set. If changes are desired, tuning commences. As used herein, control elements are control inputs that can be manipulated by the tuning controller 10 to produce a change in the operational parameters of a gas turbine. These elements can either reside within the turbine controller 10, within the plant distributed control system (DCS), or within an external controller that controls the properties of inputs into the gas turbine (such as fuel gas temperature). Examples of operational control elements include combustor fuel splits, turbine fuel/air ratio, and fuel gas inlet temperature.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">All determinations of the need for turbine tuning are performed within the tuning controller 10. The tuning operation is started based on an indicator, such as an "alarm" created by receipt of operational parameter data outside of preset operational criteria. In order for the tuning operation to be initiated, the alarm - and thus the data anomaly - must continue for a predetermined period of time.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0046" num="0046">One example of a tuning adjustment is the variation of the fuel nozzle pressure ratio to adjust combustion dynamics. With the requirement of higher firing temperatures to achieve greater flame temperatures and efficiency, turbine combustors must release more energy in a given combustor volume. Better exhaust emissions are often achieved by increasing the mixing rate of fuel and air upstream of the combustion reaction zone. The increased mixing rate is often achieved by increasing the pressure drop at the fuel nozzle discharge. As the mixing rate increases in combustors, the turbulence generated by combustion often leads to noise within the combustor and may lead to the generation of acoustic waves. Typically, acoustic waves are caused when the sound waves of the combustion flames are coupled with the acoustic characteristics of the combustor volume or the fuel system itself.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Acoustic waves may affect the internal pressure in the chamber. Where combustor pressure near a fuel nozzle rises, the rate of fuel flowing through the nozzle and the accompanying pressure drop decreases. Alternatively, a decrease in pressure near the nozzle will cause an increase in fuel flow. In cases where a low fuel nozzle pressure drop allows fuel flow oscillation, a combustor may experience amplified pressure oscillations. To combat the pressure oscillations within the combustor, combustion dynamics are monitored and the fuel air ratio and fuel nozzle pressure ratio may be modified to reduce or eliminate unwanted variations in combustor pressure, thereby curing an alarm situation or bringing the combustion system back to an acceptable level of combustion dynamics.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>, the data received from the CDMS 50, CEMS 40, fuel gas temperature controller 60 and other relevant turbine operating parameters from the turbine controller 30 may be directed through the DCS 20 to the tuning controller 10. Alternatively, although not shown, one or more of these elements may communicate directly with each other, without the need for a DCS 20. The input values are then compared to standard or target operational data for the turbine that are stored in the tuning controller as operational standards. The stored operational standards are based, at least in part, on the operational priority settings for the turbine in the form of tuning alarm levels, as will be described in more detail below. The priority settings are defined by user selected inputs on the main user interface 12 of the tuning controller 10, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>. Based on the priority settings, a series of adjustments are made to the operation of the turbine by the turbine controller 10. The adjustments are directed to the control means, including the fuel heating unit 60 (<figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>) and various other operational control elements of the turbine controller 30.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">The interface display 12 depicted in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> is the main user interface display that end users will operate to determine tuning alarm levels. The interface 12 is comprised of<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> switches (each having an On/Off indication). These switches allow the user to specify the desired tuning priorities for the operation of the turbine. In the embodiment shown, the switched operational priorities include optimum NOx emissions 14, optimum power 16 and optimum combustor dynamics 18. Each of these switches is set by the user to adjust the preferred operation of the turbine. Switching the switches from "Off" to "On" operates to change the alarm limits for each parameter. Additionally, switching some or all of the Operational Priorities 14, 16, 18 to "On" affords the user further turbine optimization though real-time adjustments of pertinent control settings via the Tuning Parameter Adjustment Interface 262 of <figref idrefs="f0019">Figure 19</figref>. Within the tuning controller 10 are functions that modify operations within the turbine, based on priorities set by the switches. The priorities may also be governed by hard coded logic in addition to user selected priorities and manual settings, as discussed in further detail below. For example, in the embodiment described here, if both the optimum NOx emissions switch 14 and the optimum power switch 16 are set to "On", the controller 10 will run in the Optimum NOx mode, not Optimum power. Thus, to run in Optimum power mode, the Optimum NOx emissions switch 14 must be "Off". In the embodiment shown, Optimum power 16 may only be selected if Optimum NOx 14 is in the off position. Optimum dynamics 18 can be selected at any time. It is explicitly noted that other User-Interface Toggle Switches (not shown) may be used, including parameters such as Optimum Heat Rate, Optimum CO emissions, Optimum Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) Life, Optimum Gas Turbine Fuel Blend Ratio, Optimal Gas Turbine Turndown Capability, etc.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050"><figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref> shows a graphical representation of the interrelationship of the interface display switches. As shown, switching one parameter "On" will alter the alarm limits to a different level than their "Off" level. In the example shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref>, the alarm limits are shown with both Optimum NOx and optimum power in the "On" position and in the "Off" position. These points on the graph are then modified by the selection of Optimum dynamics (represented throughout by the symbol δ) in either the "On" or "Off" position. The points shown on the graph of <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref> represent an exemplary set of limits for dynamics, based on the user's selected operational priorities.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">Returning to <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>, there is shown a representation of the logical flow of the determinations and calculations made within the tuning controller 10. The tuning controller 10 receives the actual operating parameters of the turbine through the turbine controller 30, combustor dynamics through the CDMS 50, and the turbine exhaust emissions through the CEMS 40. This sensor data is directed to the tuning controller 10, either directly from the elements 40, 50 and 60 mentioned above, or through the DCS 20. The received sensor data is<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> compared to stored operational standards to determine if the turbine operation is conforming to the desired settings. The operational standards are stored in the tuning controller 10 in the form of alarm levels, where normal operation of the turbine will return operational data for each parameter that is between the high and low alarm levels set for that parameter. The alarm levels for the operational standards are based on the preset operational priorities of the turbine, defined by the user switches 14, 16, 18 on the main user interface display 12 of the tuning controller 10, as discussed above with respect to <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">Based on the preset operational priorities, a hierarchical Boolean logic approach that is coded into the tuning controller 10 determines the dominant tuning concern based on operational priorities. From this logical selection, the tuning controller 10 implements a fixed incremental adjustment value for changing an operational parameter of the turbine within a maximum range of adjustment (e.g., high and low values). The tuning changes are made in a consistent, pre-determined direction over a pre-determined increment of time and are dependent on the dominant tuning concern at the time. It is contemplated that no formulaic or functional calculations are made to determine tuning adjustments; rather, the magnitude of the incremental adjustments, the direction of the adjustments, and the time span between adjustments for each control element are stored in the tuning controller 10 and selected based on the alarm(s) returned and user's operational priorities. This criteria is preferably stored in the tuning controller 10 as tuning control constraints and may be modified from time to time as desired by the user.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>, the tuning controller 10 determines whether the emissions are in compliance 100 and whether the combustor dynamics are at acceptable levels 102 by comparing the operating parameters received from the CDMS 50 and CEMS 40 respectively, to the operational standards and alarm levels saved in the tuning controller 10 as discussed above. If both are in compliance with the set operational standards, no further action is taken and the tuning controller 10 waits for the next data set from the CEMS 40 or the CDMS 50, or for other operational data from the turbine controller 30. If the data received from the CEMS 40 or the CDMS 50 is non-conforming with the operational standards, i.e. above or below alarm levels, as is the case with step 104 of <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>, the tuning operation moves to the next tuning step of first determining the dominant tuning concern 106. The logical adjustment of turbine operation is defined by the dominant tuning concern 106, which is based, at least in part, on the preset operational priorities set within the user interface 12, as will be discussed below with respect to <figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 8</figref>.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">Once the dominant tuning concern is determined, the tuning controller 10 will attempt to correct the operational parameter to ensure that the levels are within the operational standards<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> stored in the tuning controller 10. In a preferred embodiment of the operation, to correct a tuning issue, the tuning controller 10 will first attempt to incrementally change the turbine combustor fuel splits 108. The fuel split determines the distribution of the fuel flow to the fuel nozzles in each combustor. If adjusting the fuel splits 108 does not resolve the tuning issue and place the operational parameters data back into conformance with the operational standards, a further adjustment to an additional operational control element is performed. Such additional operational control elements may be other fuel splits (in the case of a system with multiple fuel splits, often referred to as FS1, FS2, etc) or other features of operation, such as fuel air ratio or fuel temperature. In the example shown, the next incremental adjustment may be a change of the fuel gas temperature set point. In this adjustment step, the tuning controller 10 sends a modified fuel gas inlet temperature signal to the DCS 20, which is then directed to the fuel heating unit 60.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">After the incremental steps are taken in step 108, a check at step 110, is made to see if modification of the combustor fuel splits and/or fuel gas inlet temperature resolved the tuning issue. If further tuning corrections are needed, the tuning controller 10 will alter the overall fuel/air ratio 112. This approach makes changes to the turbine thermal cycle utilizing fixed incremental changes over pre-determined amounts of time. The step of modifying the fuel/air ration 112 is intended to adjust the exhaust temperature (up or down) in accordance with predetermined, standard control curves for the turbine operation, which are maintained within the memory of the tuning controller 10.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">In the present disclosure, the normal mode of communication provides tuning changes utilizing control signals intended for a given control element that are directed by the tuning controller to the turbine controller 30 through the DCS 20. However, the control signals can also be communicated directly to the turbine controller 30, without use of the DCS 20. These adjustments are implemented directly within the various controller means within the system or through the turbine controller 30. When the operational data is returned to within the desired operational standards, the tuning settings are held in place by the tuning controller 10 pending an alarm resulting from non-conforming data received from the sensor means 40, 50, 60.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">The adjustments sent from the tuning controller 10 to the turbine controller 30 or the associated controller means are preferably fixed in magnitude. Thus, the adjustments are not recalculated with new data or optimized to a target. The adjustments are part of an "open loop." Once started, the adjustments move incrementally to the preset maximum or maximum within a specified range, unless an interim adjustment places the operation data into conformance with the operational standards or a new dominant tuning concern arises. Under most circumstances, when the full incremental range for one operational control element is completed, the tuning<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> controller 10 moves on to the next operational control element, which is defined by the preset operational priorities and dominant tuning concern. The logic of the tuning controller 10 drives the adjustment of operational control elements on a step-by-step basis, where the incremental steps of adjustment for each control element are stored within the memory of the tuning controller 10.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">The tuning controller 10 preferably addresses one operational control element at a time. For example, the dominant tuning concern 106 dictates the first adjustment to be made. In the preferred example discussed above, the fuel distribution control element is first adjusted in step 108. As indicated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>, during this step, the fuel split of fuel circuit 1 is addressed, followed by the split for fuel circuit 2.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">It should be noted that the application of fuel circuits 1 and 2 is general in nature and can be applied to the specific hardware configuration within any particular combustion system. Therefore, this tuning approach is applicable to any combustion system, regardless if it has only one fuel split, two fuel splits, or more than two fuel splits. If the combustion system has only one useful fuel split, then this second tuning step or adjusting fuel circuit 2 may be left within the tuning algorithm; but, abandoned in-place. If the combustion system has more than 2 fuel splits, then the 2 most effective fuel split "knobs" or control elements are utilized, or there are additional adjustments to the remaining fuel splits as dictated by the particular combustion system being tuned. Last, the user can turn off the tuning of the 2<sup>nd</sup> fuel circuit, thereby allowing only one fuel circuit to be used in tuning.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">The fuel gas inlet temperature adjustment generally follows the fuel split adjustments when needed. Within each step, there is an incremental adjustment, followed by a time lag to permit the adjusted turbine operation to stabilize. After the time lag, if the current operational data analyzed by the tuning controller 10 indicates that turbine operation still remains outside of the operational standards, the next incremental adjustment is made. This pattern repeats for each step. Under most circumstances, only when one adjustment step is completed does the tuning controller move onto the next operational control element.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">The tuning controller 10 preferably controls combustion operation to maintain proper tuning in variable conditions of ambient temperature, humidity and pressure, all of which vary over time and have a significant effect on turbine operation. The tuning controller 10 may also maintain the tuning of the turbine during variation in fuel composition. Variation in fuel composition may cause a change in the heat release, which can lead to unacceptable emissions, unstable combustion, or even blow out. The tuning controller 10 preferably does not serve to adjust fuel composition to compensate; rather, it tunes the operational control elements (fuel gas<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> distribution, fuel gas inlet temperature, and/or turbine fuel/air ratio) to address the effects on combustion output and discharge. However, an embodiment where the tuning controller 10 also serves to adjust fuel composition may be incorporated into the present system with additional control architecture.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">In other tuning scenarios, an alternate order for the adjustments is contemplated. For example, if the dominant tuning concern is high NOx emissions, the fuel temperature adjustment may be skipped, going directly to the operational control curves to adjust fuel/air ratio. If, however, Class 1 dynamics is the dominant tuning concern, the incremental fuel temperature adjustment may be performed before going to the operational control curves. Alternatively, the step of making adjustments to control elements in accordance with the operational fuel air ratio control curves may be turned off completely, based on a user's priorities.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063"><figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 5</figref> provides a schematic that details the framework for determining the dominant tuning concern 106, as included in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>. Future steps will be described below with respect to <figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 8</figref>. First, relevant emissions parameters 120 and combustor dynamics 122 are received by the tuning controller 10 from the CEMS 40 and CDMS 50, as detailed above. The relevant emissions parameters 120 and combustor dynamics 122 are then compared to allowable tuning limits 124 that are also provided to the tuning controller 10. The allowable tuning limits are in the form of preset ranges that may be adjusted using the tuning interface 12 of <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> and Tuning Parameter Adjustment Interface 262 of <figref idrefs="f0019">Figure 19</figref>, and determined according to the logic set forth below with respect to <figref idrefs="f0006">Figures 6</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0007">7</figref>. The output of this comparison is a series of "True" alarms 126 of various tuning concerns, where an alarm condition is indicated if the sensed operational data 120, 122 is above or below a given alarm range set forth in the tuning limits 124.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">Alarm conditions may have more than one level or tier. For example, there may be varying degrees of severity of an alarm, such as: high "H"; high-high "HH"; high-high-high "HHH" and low "L"; low-low "L"; low-low-low "LLL". The "True" logical alarms 126 are subsequently ranked according to their level of importance (e.g. high - high "HH" alarms are more important than high "H" alarms, etc) in step 130. If more than one tuning concern shares the same level, the tuning concerns will then be ranked according to the user preferences as set forth below with respect to <figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 8</figref>. If only one "True" alarm emerges, this will be selected and used as the dominant tuning concern 106 to initiate the tuning process as set forth in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>. However, the results of the process of <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 5</figref>, namely the ranked "True" alarms 130, will be processed through user determined criteria, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 8</figref>, before a dominant tuning concern 106 is confirmed.<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --></p><p id="p0065" num="0065">In <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 6</figref>, a flow chart is provided to explain how the allowable tuning limits 124 are determined. Once determined, the tuning limits 124 are compared to the operational data 120, 122 as set forth above and shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 5</figref>. First, the User Interface Toggle Switches 14, 16, 18 corresponding to those in the interface display 12 of <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>, are compared against each other, utilizing an internal hierarchy to allow passage of the alarm constraints relative to the most significant toggle switch. Thus, depending on which switches are in the "On" position, different tuning limits will be included in the allowable tuning limits 124. Each of Optimum NOx, Optimum Power and Optimum Dynamics has a collection of preset limits (denoted by the numerals 134, 136 and 138 in <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 6</figref>), depending on whether the corresponding toggle switch 14, 16, 18 is in the "On" of "Off" position. There is also an internal set of default limits 140 to be used when none of the toggle switches are in the "On" position. Additionally, if some or all of the User Interface Toggle Switches 14, 16, or 18 are selected "On", the Tuning Parameter Adjustment Interface 262 of <figref idrefs="f0019">Figure 19</figref> can be utilized by the user/operator in real-time, to adjust relevant tuning limits, with further internal controls to ensure valid limits are entered.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">The internal hierarchy will determine which tuning limits shall take precedence in the event that competing toggle switches 14, 16 or 18 are in the "On" position. In the present example, the hierarchy ranks Optimum NOx above Optimum Power. Optimum Dynamics may be selected at any time and will simply alter the tuning limits of the other selections given, such as is shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 4</figref>. If Optimum NOx 14 and Optimum Power 16 are both in the "On" position, the tuning limits for Optimum NOx 134 will be used. In addition to the internal tuning limits, the Tuning Parameter Adjustment Interface 262 of <figref idrefs="f0019">Figure 19</figref> can be used to change the actual High and Low NOx tuning limits 250, 252 in real-time. Additionally, the tuning limits for Optimum Dynamics 138 are utilized if this toggle switch 18 is activated. Likewise manual adjustment of the high Class 1 and Class 2 dynamics settings 254, 256 can be conducted manually using the Tuning Parameter Adjustment Interface 262 of <figref idrefs="f0019">Figure 19</figref>. If no User Interface Toggle Switches 14, 16, 18 are active, default tuning limits 140 are provided as the allowable tuning limits 124, and the Tuning Parameter Adjustment Interface 262 of <figref idrefs="f0019">Figure 19</figref> will not be operable to change any of the tuning settings. All of the tuning limits 134, 136, 138 and 140 that may be used to construct the allowable tuning limits for the tuning controller 10 may be developed by the end user and programmers and can be hard coded into the tuning controller 10 or real-time adjusted in real time using the Tuning Parameter Adjustment Interface 262, provided some Optimization Criteria 14, 16, 18 are selected "On", for a given application.

In this example, the tuning limits for High NOx, High High NOx, High Class 1 δP's, High Class 2 δP's will be determined based on preset tuning limits and the user's preferences. The various exemplary tuning limits are provided for Optimum NOx 134, Optimum Power 136, Optimum Dynamics 138, and No Optimal Settings 140 are given corresponding numerical values (shown respectively in blocks 152, 154, 156 and 158). The corresponding numerical values given for each criterion vary, such that the allowable limits 124 will be different depending on which toggle switches 14, 16 or 18 are selected and associated manual tuning settings are manipulated using their respective Tuning Parameter Adjustment Interface 262 control devices 250, 252, 254, 256. By way of example, the Optimum NOx 134, 152 and Optimum Power 136, 154 give limits for NOx, but also provide limits for Dynamics that are to be used in the event that Optimum Dynamics 138, 156 is not selected. However, in the event that the Optimum Dynamics toggle 18 is selected, the Class 1 δP's and Class 2 δP's values provided therefor 156 shall be used instead of the values listed with respect to Optimum NOx 134, 152 and Optimum Power 136, 154.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">In this particular example, the toggle switches for Optimum NOx 14 and Optimum Dynamics 18 are selected, with the switch for Optimum Power 16 left in the "Off" position. Thus, the values from Optimum NOx for High NOx and High High NOx 152 are provided. Also, because Optimum Dynamics 18 is also selected, the Dynamics values for High Class 1 δP's and High Class 2 δP's 138, 156 replace those δP's values provided with respect to Optimum NOx 134, 152. As a result, the allowable tuning limits 124 are provided as shown in block 160. These allowable tuning limits 124 correspond to those used in <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 5</figref>, as described above, to determine whether information from the CEMS 40 and CDMS 50 is in an alarm state or operating normally.

It is this tuning concern 106 which dictates the turbine operational changes the turbine controller 10 performs, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>.<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --></p><p id="p0070" num="0070">First, a determination is made of all potential dominant tuning issues 142. These include, but are not limited to: combustor blowout, CO emissions, NOx emissions, Class 1 combustor dynamics (Class 1 δP's), and Class 2 combustor dynamics (Class 2 δP's). The list of potential dominant tuning issues 142 is determined by the user and programmer and may be based on a number of factors or operational criteria. By way of example, Class 1 and Class 2 combustor dynamics δP's refer to combustion dynamics occurring over specific ranges of acoustic frequencies, whereby the range of frequencies is different between Classes 1 and 2. Indeed, many combustion systems can possess different acoustic resonant frequencies corresponding to Class 1 and Class 2, and variations in these two dynamics classes may be mitigated utilizing different turbine operational parameter changes for each different turbine and / or combustor arrangement. It should also be noted that certain combustion systems may have none, 1, 2, or greater than 2 different "classes" (frequency ranges) of combustor dynamics which can be tuned. This disclosure utilizes a system whereby two different combustor dynamics classes are mentioned. However, it is fully intended that this disclosure can be broadly applied to any number of distinct dynamics frequency classes (from 0 to greater than 2).</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">After determination of the potential dominant tuning issues 142, these issues are ranked in order of significance 144 according to the end user's needs as well as the detrimental effects that each tuning concern can have on the environment and / or turbine performance. The relative importance of each potential dominant tuning concern can be different with each end user, and for each combustor arrangement. For example, some combustion systems will demonstrate an extreme sensitivity to combustor dynamics, such that normal daily operational parameter variations can cause a normally benign dynamics tuning concern to become catastrophic in a very short amount of time. In this case, one or both of the dominant dynamics tuning concerns (Class 1 and Class 2) may be elevated to Priority 1 (Most Important). By way of example in <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 7</figref>, combustor blowout is listed as the most important Dominant Tuning Concern 144. This ranking is used to determine the dominant tuning concern in the event that there are multiple alarms with equal levels of severity. This ranking of Dominant Tuning Concerns 144, from most to least important, provides the overall framework where the specific Boolean Logic Hierarchy 148 is created. For example, assuming Class 1 and Class 2 δP's obey generally monotonic behavior relative to perturbations in system operational parameters, a High-High "HH" Class 2 δP's alarm may be more significant than High "H" Class 1 δP's alarm. Additionally, in the example given in <figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 8</figref> for the Boolean Logic Hierarchy 148, High "H" NOx emissions is more significant than High "H" Class 2 dynamics. This means that if both High "H" NOx and High "H" Class 2 dynamics are both "in alarm" (Logic = True), in the<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> absence of other alarms being "True", the autotuning system will tune for High "H" NOx because it is the dominant tuning concern. Finally, it can be seen that Blowout is ranked above NOx Emissions and both are ranked above Class 1 δP's. Thus, if there were high "H" alarms returned for all three categories, Blowout would be the dominant tuning concern, followed by NOx Emissions and then Class 1 δP's. This Boolean Logic Hierarchy 148 will be what is compared to the "True" alarms 130 returned by comparing the allowable tuning limits 124 to the operational data 120, 122 as set forth above with respect to <figref idrefs="f0005">Figure 5</figref>.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">All "True" tuning alarms 130 are provided as ranked by severity (e.g. HHH above HH, etc.). The "True" tuning alarms 130 are then compared with the hard-coded Boolean Logic Hierarchy 148, in step 150 to determine which tuning will become the "True" Dominant Tuning Concern 106. This one "True" Dominant Tuning Concern 106 is now passed into the remainder of the autotuning algorithm, as detailed in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>, as the Dominant Tuning Concern 106 to be mitigated by operational changes.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073"><figref idrefs="f0009 f0010 f0011 f0012">Figures 9-12</figref> provide exemplary visual representations of the autotuning system interface depicting how the Boolean Logic Hierarchy works in practice. <figref idrefs="f0009">Figure 9</figref> shows the alarms returned in connection with the example set forth above with respect to <figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 8</figref>. Namely, alarms are returned for Class 2 δP's at the levels of H 162, HH 164 and HHH 166. In addition, alarms for NOx 168 and Class 1 δP's 170 are returned at the H level. Since more extreme levels trump conflicts of different alarms at the same level, the HHH Class 2 δP's is the priority and therefore the dominant tuning concern 172.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074"><figref idrefs="f0010 f0011 f0012">Figures 10-12</figref> show various further examples of the dominant tuning concern for different "True" alarm levels under the user defined hierarchy 144 of <figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 8</figref>. <figref idrefs="f0010">Figure 10</figref> shows a NOx alarm at the HH level returned, with no other alarms of this severity. Thus, high NOx is the dominant tuning concern. <figref idrefs="f0011">Figure 11</figref> shows a Class 1 δP's at an H level as the only alarm condition, thus making Class 1 δP's as the dominant tuning concern. Finally, <figref idrefs="f0012">Figure 12</figref> shows that Class 2 δP's and Blowout both return alarms at the H level. Referring to the user ranking of dominant tuning issues 144 in <figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 8</figref>, Blowout is ranked as a priority above Class 2 δP's and thus, although the severity of the alarms is equal, Blowout becomes the dominant tuning concern.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">In <figref idrefs="f0013 f0014 f0015 f0016">Figures 13-16</figref>, there is shown various examples of the operational results of a tuning operation of a tuning controller of the present disclosure based on operational data from a running turbine system. In <figref idrefs="f0013">Figure 13</figref>, the dominant tuning concern is high Class 2 δP's, and a change in the combustor fuel split E1 is made in reaction to a high Class 2 δP's alarm generated when the combustor dynamics moves outside of the set operational priorities for optimum<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> dynamics. The actual combustor dynamics data received by the turbine controller 10 from, for example, the CDMS 50 is designated as 200 in the graph. The moving average for the combustor dynamics is identified in the graph as 202. When the combustor dynamics exceed the dynamics alarm limit value 204 for a set period of time TA an alarm goes off within the tuning controller. This alarm causes the first event E1 and a resulting incremental adjustment in the combustor fuel split tuning parameter 206. As illustrated, the incremental increase in the fuel split causes a corresponding drop in the combustor dynamics 200, with the average combustor dynamics 202 dropping below the dynamics alarm limit 204. As time continues, the tuning is held by the tuning controller and the average combustor dynamics 202 maintains its operational position below the dynamics limit 204. Thus, no further adjustments necessary or alarms issued.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">In <figref idrefs="f0014">Figure 14</figref>, the dominant tuning concern is high NOx emissions. As NOx emissions data 210 is received from the tuning controller, an alarm is generated after the passage of time TA. The alarm is caused by the NOx emissions 210 exceeding the operational standard or tuning limit 212. The alarm activates a first event E1 resulting in an incremental increase in the fuel split 214. After a period of time TB from the first event E1, the NOx alarm is still activated due to the NOx emissions 210 exceeding the preset tuning limit 212. This continued alarm after time TB causes a second event E2 and a second incremental increase in the fuel split value 214. This second increase is equal in magnitude to the first incremental increase. The second event E2 causes the NOx emissions level 210 to drop below the preset limit 212 within the review time period and halts the alarm. As the NOx emissions 210 remains below the limit 212, the fuel split 214 tuning is held and the operation of the turbine continues with the defined operational parameters.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">In <figref idrefs="f0015">Figure 15</figref>, the dominant tuning concern is low NOx emissions / Blowout, with the alarm created by a low reading received by tuning controller. As shown, the NOx tuning limit 220 is defined. Upon passage of the set time period TA from receiving NOx level data 222, the alarm is generated and a first event E1 occurs. At the first event E1, the fuel split level 224 is incrementally adjusted downward. After a set passage of time TB from event E1 additional NOx emissions data 222 is received and compared to the preset alarm level 220. Because the NOx is still below the alarm level 220, a second event E2 occurs resulting in a further incremental reduction in the fuel split value 224. A further passage of time TC from event E2 occurs and additional data is received. Again, the NOx data 212 is low, maintaining the alarm and resulting in a further event E3. At event E3, the fuel split value 224 is again reduced by the same incremental amount. This third incremental adjustment results in the NOx emissions 222 rising<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> above the preset limit 220 and results in removal of the alarm. The fuel split 224 tuning value set after event E3 is held in place by the tuning controller 10.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">In <figref idrefs="f0016">Figure 16</figref>, the NOx emissions data 230 received by the tuning controller 10 is again tracking along the lower emissions limit 232, resulting in a low NOx / Blowout dominant tuning concern. At the first tuning event E1, the fuel split value 234 is incrementally dropped to result in a corresponding increase in the NOx emissions 230 over the lower limit 232. After this first incremental adjustment, the NOx emissions for a period of time holds above the limit 232 and then begins to again fall. At the second tuning event E2, the fuel split value 234 is again adjusted by the designated fixed incremental value. This second adjustment then places the fuel split value 234 at its defined minimum within the preset range of allowable values (determined as a hard coded limit within the tuning controller 10). Because this limit is reached, the tuning operation moves to the next operational parameter, which is normally the second fuel circuit adjustment. In the example provided, this second circuit value (not shown) is already at its set maximum/minimum and is therefore not adjusted. Thus, the tuning operation moves on to the next operational parameter, load control curves 236. As shown, at event E2 an incremental adjustment is made in the load control curve value 236. The increase in the load control curve value (turbine fuel to air ratio) 236 results in a corresponding increase in the NOx emission 230 to a value above the minimum 232 and removes the alarm. Upon removal of the alarm, the tuning settings are held and no further adjustments are made. The tuning controller 10 then proceeds to receive data from the sensor means, through the DCS, and continues to make comparisons with the set operational standards (including the minimum NOx emissions limit EL).</p><p id="p0079" num="0079"><figref idrefs="f0017">Figures 17</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0018">18</figref> are examples of schematic representations of the operation of the tuning controller within contemplated disclosure. The operation of the turbine is defined by the emission output of the turbine, both NOx and CO, turbine dynamics and flame stability. In <figref idrefs="f0017">Figure 17</figref>, a tuned system is defined by a preferred operating envelope in the center of the operational diamond. This preferred operational envelope is typically manually set based on a prior start-up or operation of the turbine system. However, weather changes, both hot and cold, and mechanical changes within the turbine system cause a drift within the operational diamond. Hence a tuning is desired so as to maintain the turbine operation within the preferred range.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">In <figref idrefs="f0018">Figure 18</figref>, a defined buffer or margin 132 is set within the operational diamond to serve as a warning for a drift of the turbine operation outside of the preferred operational envelope. Once one of the sensed operational values reaches the defined buffer line or limit, an alarm is generated, causing a tuning event. Based on the direction of the drift, the tuning<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> controller creates a preset reaction to meet the specifics of the tuning need. This preset reaction is a defined incremental shift in an operational control element of the turbine as a means for moving the turbine operational envelope back into the desired range, and away from the buffer limit. It should be noted that each parameter may have more than one alarm, such as high "H"; high-high "HH" and high-high-high "HHH." These alarms may be sequentially located around the diamond shown to alert operators of how close the turbine operation is to the outside of desired operational limits.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081"><figref idrefs="f0019">Figure 19</figref> delineates the Tuning Parameter Adjustment Interface 262, whereby the user/operator can adjust the tuning parameters in real-time to meet their respective operational goals. The Tuning Parameter Adjustment Interface 262 is preferably a graphical user interface, such as a computer monitor or other screen that may be operable using a computer mouse, track ball or touch screen technology. The tuning parameters are adjusted by sliding the respective parameter adjustment control device up/down, whereby the maximum and minimum limits for each tuning parameter can be programmatically modified as desired. Each tunable parameter control device 250, 252, 254, 256 is independent of any of the other parameters. For instance, manually adjusting High NOx 250 has no direct influence on the High Class 1 dynamics limits 254. Activation of these tuning parameter adjustments is achieved only with an "On" or "True" Boolean setting for their respective turbine Operational Priorities 14, 16, 18, as identified in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>. For instance, Selecting Optimum NOX Emissions 14, shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref>, "On" activates the ability to manually adjust High NOx 250 and Low NOx 252 only.
