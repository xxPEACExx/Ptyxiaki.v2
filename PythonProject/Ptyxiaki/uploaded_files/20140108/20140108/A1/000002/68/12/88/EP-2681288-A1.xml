For example, a bonded article may be formed by bonding two substrates made of polymer together when one or both of the substrates is made of a polymer that contains one or more fatty amide as a slip agent. Such slip agents are sometimes added to a polymer so that the surface of a substrate made from that polymer will have relatively low coefficient of friction. One problem that arises in such systems is that the slip agent may migrate from the substrate into the adhesive, thereby depleting the amount of slip agent in the substrate and </p><p id="p0004" num="0004">consequently increasing the coefficient of friction of that substrate. </p><p id="p0005" num="0005"> [0003] One method that has been used in the past to reduce depletion of slip agent from the substrate has been to incorporate some slip agent into the adhesive composition prior to bonding with the substrate. For example, when the adhesive composition is either a solvent- free adhesive composition or is a composition in which the adhesive is dissolved in an organic solvent, it is often possible to dissolve some slip agent in the adhesive composition. Then, when a layer of the adhesive composition is formed on a surface of a substrate that contains slip agent, the layer of adhesive will also contain some slip agent, and the presence of slip agent in the layer of adhesive composition will reduce the tendency toward depletion of slip agent from the substrate. The substrate will therefore maintain its relatively low coefficient of friction. </p><p id="p0006" num="0006"> [0004] It is often desired to use an adhesive composition that is waterborne. Slip agents are not normally soluble in water, and addition of slip agent to a waterborne composition usually results in a mixture that is unacceptable because of phase separation, instability, or other undesirable result of incompatibility of the ingredients. Therefore the method described above for maintaining the coefficient of friction of the substrate by adding slip agent to the adhesive composition would not be effective when the adhesive composition is waterborne. </p><p id="p0007" num="0007">[0005] US Patent Publication 2009/0142610 describes a hot melt adhesive composition that contains a fatty amide.

The third aspect of the present invention is a bonded article made by the method of the second aspect of the present invention. </p><p id="p0010" num="0010"> [0009] The following is a detailed description of the invention. </p><p id="p0011" num="0011"> [0010] As used herein, the following terms have the designated definitions, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. </p><p id="p0012" num="0012"> [0011] A "polymer," as used herein and as defined by FW Billmeyer, JR. in Textbook of Polymer Science, second edition, 1971, is a relatively large molecule made up of the reaction products of smaller chemical repeat units. </p><p id="p0013" num="0013"> [0012] Polymer molecular weights can be measured by standard methods such as, for example, size exclusion chromatography (SEC, also called gel permeation chromatography or GPC). Generally, polymers have weight- average molecular weight (Mw) of 1,000 or more. Some polymers are characterized by Mn, the number- average molecular weight. </p><p id="p0014" num="0014">[0013] Some polymers exhibit one or more glass transition temperature (Tg). Tg is determined using differential scanning calorimetry with the midpoint method. </p><p id="p0015" num="0015">[0014] As used herein "weight of polymer" means the dry weight of polymer. </p><p id="p0016" num="0016">[0015] Molecules that can react with each other to form the repeat units of a polymer are known herein as "monomers." Vinyl monomers are monomers that have at least one carbon- carbon double bond that is not part of an aromatic ring and that is capable of participating in a polymerization reaction with other carbon-carbon double bonds. Vinyl monomers have molecular weight of less than 500. Vinyl monomers include, for example, styrene, substituted styrenes, dienes, ethylene, ethylene derivatives, and mixtures thereof. Ethylene derivatives include, for example, unsubstituted and substituted versions of the following: vinyl acetate, acrylonitrile, (meth)acrylic acids, alkyl esters of (meth)acrylic acid, amides of (meth)acrylic acid, vinyl chloride, halogenated alkenes, and mixtures thereof. As used

 herein, "(meth) acrylic" means acrylic or methacrylic; "(meth)acrylate" means acrylate or methacrylate; and "(meth)acrylamide" means acrylamide or methacrylamide. "Substituted" means having at least one attached chemical group such as, for example, alkyl group, alkenyl group, vinyl group, hydroxyl group, carboxylic acid group, other functional groups, and combinations thereof. </p><p id="p0017" num="0017"> [0016] An aromatic vinyl monomer is a vinyl monomer the molecule of which contains one or more aromatic ring. A vinyl monomer that is not an aromatic vinyl monomer is referred to herein as a "non-aromatic vinyl monomer." An olefin monomer is a vinyl monomer the molecule of which contains only hydrogen and oxygen. </p><p id="p0018" num="0018">[0017] A polymer that is made by polymerizing a certain monomer, either alone or with other monomers, is said herein to include that monomer as a polymerized unit. </p><p id="p0019" num="0019">[0018] As used herein, a monomer is nonionic if, when a polymer that contains polymerized units of that monomer is present in water, there is no pH condition between pH of 2.5 and a pH of 9 at which the polymerized units of that monomer are ionized.

In a waterbome composition, water forms a continuous medium, and all the other ingredients are dissolved or dispersed or a combination thereof in the water. </p><p id="p0022" num="0022"> [0021] As used herein the "solids level" of a waterbome composition is the amount of material that is left behind when a layer of the waterbome composition is applied to a substrate and then dried or allowed to dry. Solids level may be measured by making a layer of the waterbome composition that is 1 mm to 2 mm in depth in a container that is open at the top; and placing that container in a circulating-air oven at 100°C for 30 minutes. The solids level, expressed as a percentage, is 100 * (LB) / (IC), where LB is the weight of material from the waterbome composition that remains in the container after the oven exposure, and IC is the initial weight of the waterbome composition. The material from the waterbome composition that remains in the container after the oven exposure is known herein as the "solids portion" of the composition.
