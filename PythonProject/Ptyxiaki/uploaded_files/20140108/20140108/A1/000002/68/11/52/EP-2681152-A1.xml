id="p0002" num="0002">TECHNICAL FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p><p id="p0003" num="0003"> [0001] The present invention relates generally to the field of mountable kitchen utensils such as for use in an aircraft galley, and more particularly, to a cork puller mounted on a support configured to move the cork puller between a compact stowed position and a deployed use position. </p><p id="p0004" num="0004"> [0002] Aircraft and other moving conveyances having galleys typically include unique utensil designs and ways of storing utensils that best utilize the limited space available and prevent shifting during movement. With regard to aircraft galleys and other conveyances used for commercial passengers, it is also desirable to fix utensils in place so that they are easily located and to prevent loss. With regard to aircraft in particular, it is also desirable to mount potentially dangerous items (e.g., sharp items) in place so that they cannot be used as weapons. </p><p id="p0005" num="0005"> [0003] One such utensil commonly found in a galley, such as an aircraft galley, is a cork puller. Cork pullers typically include a helical coil made of metal that terminates in a sharp point that is screwed into a cork and pulled upward to remove the cork from a bottle, such as a wine bottle. Conventional cork pullers are typically loose, hand-held utensils stored in a drawer between uses. Because cork pullers may be used multiple times during each flight, and because cork pullers can potentially be used as weapons, it would be desirable to provide a cork puller that is fixed in a convenient location to prevent loss and its use as a weapon. It would further be desirable to provide a cork puller that mounts within a galley in a manner that is convenient for use and makes efficient use of limited space.

However, the invention may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the representative embodiments set forth herein. The exemplary embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be both thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention and enable one of ordinary skill in the art to make, use and practice the invention.

 throughout the various drawings. </p><p id="p0031" num="0031"> [0027] The mountable cork puller disclosed herein is configured to be mounted on a support wall such as a bulkhead, galley cabinet or other support wall. Although the mountable cork puller is described herein as being mounted to a support wall in an aircraft galley, the mountable cork puller is suitable for being mounted to any support structure, such as in a home, restaurant kitchen, bar or any other facility where corked bottles are opened. Mounting the cork puller on a support wall allows the cork puller to be stowed away when not in use, provides a means of holding the cork puller during use, frees one hand for holding the bottle, fixes the cork puller to the wall and prevents loss of the cork puller, among other advantages. </p><p id="p0032" num="0032"> [0028] As used herein, the term "cork puller" in intended to broadly describe any device for drawing a cork or stopper from a bottle or other container. Although most cork pullers include a helical coil terminating in a sharp point that is turned to advance into a cork, other types of cork pullers may be used with this invention. Although the cork puller shown and described herein includes a specific handle and screw configuration, it is envisioned that the shapes and configurations may be changed without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, alternative cork puller configurations may include twist-type T- bar handles, press levers, wing gears and twin-prong cork pullers, among others. </p><p id="p0033" num="0033"> [0029] Referring to FIGS. 1-3, a mountable cork puller according to an embodiment of the present invention is shown generally at reference numeral 10. The overall assembly in its stowed position has a thickness substantially less than its length or height, and thus may be mounted recessed within a wall having a small thickness, such as a cabinet or bulkhead. As shown, the assembly is mounted within a recess "R" in a galley wall "G" sufficiently deep to fully contain the thickness dimension of the assembly. In the stowed 
<!-- EPO <DP n="8"/>-->
 position, the assembly sits substantially flush with the support wall. </p><p id="p0034" num="0034"> [0030] The assembly includes a generally rectangular-shaped tray 12 that is open on one major side thereof for housing a movable cork puller 14 between uses. The tray 12 has a depth substantially corresponding to the thickness of the cork puller 14 such that the cork puller can be stowed entirely within the tray between uses. The shape of the tray 12 and the dimensions thereof may be sized and shaped to correspond to the shape of the cork puller 14. The tray 12 has sidewalls 16 that extend "upwardly" from the bottom that define the depth of the tray. The tray 12 further includes horizontal flanges 18 that extend </p><p id="p0035" num="0035">perpendicularly outwardly from the sidewalls that overlap the galley wall G. The tray 12 may be secured to/within the galley wall G using fasteners, adhesive, etc. </p><p id="p0036" num="0036"> [0031] The assembly further includes a swinging hinge 20 mounted on a hinge pin 22 for moving the cork puller 14 between its stowed and deployed use positions. The hinge 20 is a substantially planar member, for example constructed of aluminum, that is attached at its free end to the cork puller 14. As shown, the hinge pin 22 is received through openings in the top and bottom sidewalls of the tray and is angled slightly with respect to vertical. The angle of the hinge pin 22 causes the cork puller 14 to raise and angle slightly upward as it moves toward its deployed use position. </p><p id="p0037" num="0037"> [0032] The hinge 20 defines a finger hole 24 therethrough for moving the cork puller 14 between its stowed and deployed use positions. The hinge 20 may be locked in place in the stowed position by a flange 26 that protrudes slightly into the opening of the tray 12. To move the cork puller 14 from its stowed position, the hinge 20 is lifted upward to clear the flange 26 such that the free end of the hinge is free to swing outward. As shown, clearance is provided between the top of the tray 12 and the top sidewall 16 for lifting the hinge 20 within the tray. The hinge 20 may further be angled slightly such that the cork 
<!-- EPO <DP n="9"/>-->
 puller 14 is full to swing about a full 180 degrees between its stowed and deployed use positions, as shown in FIG. 2. In the deployed use position, the angled mounting pin 22 deploys the cork puller 14 at an upward, ergonomic angle comfortable for use. </p><p id="p0038" num="0038"> [0033] The cork puller 14 mounts to the free end of the hinge 20 with its handle 28 extending in the direction generally away from the hinge. The screw 30 is coaxial with a screw housing 32 and extends downward. </p><p id="p0039" num="0039"> [0034] Referring to FIG. 4, the cork puller 14 in the fully deployed position is entirely forward of the galley wall G, thus conveniently positioned for use without obstructions. Because the assembly requires room to swing between the stowed and deployed use positions, the assembly is preferably mounted in a position away from another support wall or from an object in the swinging pathway of the cork puller 14. </p><p id="p0040" num="0040"> [0035] Referring to FIG. 5, the handle 28 is pivotally attached to the hinge 20 such that the handle can be raised and lowered to move the screw 28 away from the hinge 20 for access. The screw housing 32, which also serves as a bottle neck positioning collar, is pivotally attached to the cork puller 14 and thus can be swung upward to receive the neck of the bottle 34. The screw housing 32 may pivot independent of the pivoting movement of the handle 28. </p><p id="p0041" num="0041"> [0036] To remove a cork, the handle 28 is lifted and the neck of the bottle 34 is inserted under the screw housing 32, which tilts out slightly to accommodate the neck of the bottle, and is held in the correct position in relation to the screw 28 by the housing. As shown in FIG. 6, the handle 28 is depressed into the shown position, driving the screw 28 into the cork. The same position from a different view is shown in FIG. 7. To remove the cork, the handle 28 is lifted and the mouth of the bottle 34 is forced against the screw housing 32. As the handle 28 is lifted further, the cork is removed from the bottle 34. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="10"/>-->
 [0037] The cork puller 14 is therefore conveniently available for use, protected against pilferage, misuse or loss. The assembly is easily installed as a retrofit item in an existing fixture, or can be factory-installed for original equipment installation. The assembly is particularly convenient and space-saving in environments where space is at a premium. </p><p id="p0042" num="0042"> [0038] The foregoing description provides embodiments of the invention by way of example only. It is envisioned that other embodiments may perform similar functions and/or achieve similar results.
