In the drawing, a hoisting machine 1 is installed in an upper part of a hoistway. The hoisting machine 1 includes a driving sheave 2, a motor 3 for rotating the driving sheave 2, and a brake device 4 for braking the rotation of the driving sheave 2. In the vicinity of the hoisting machine 1, a deflector sheave 5 is provided.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">A plurality of main ropes 6 (only one thereof is illustrated in the drawing) is looped around the driving sheave 2 and the deflector sheave 5. A car 7 and a counterweight 8 corresponding to<br/>

In the hoistway, a pair of car guide rails 9 for guiding the ascent/descent of the car 7, and a pair of counterweight guide rails (not shown) for guiding the ascent/descent of the counterweight 8 are provided.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The motor 3 and the brake device 4 are controlled by a controller 11. Specifically, a travel of the car 7 is controlled by the controller 11.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In the upper part of the hoistway, an upper pulley 12 is provided. In a lower part of the hoistway, a lower pulley 13 is provided. A speed detection rope 14 is looped around the upper pulley 12 and the lower pulley 13. Both ends of the speed detection rope 14 are connected to a safety device (rope securing device) 15 provided for the car 7.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">When the car 7 is raised and lowered, the speed detection rope 14 is circulated to rotate the upper pulley 12 at a speed according to the car speed. A rotation detector 16 for generating a signal according to the rotation speed of the upper pulley 12, specifically, a signal according to the car speed, is provided in the upper pulley 12. As the rotation detector 16, for example, an encoder is used.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The signal from the rotation detector 16 is input to the controller 11.

The car stopper 23 is connected to the car buffer 21 at the time of the maintenance work and is caused to abut against the car 7 to limit a lowered position of the car 7. Specifically, the connection of the car stopper 23 to the car buffer 21 allows a distance between a lower part of the car 7 and a bottom part of the hoistway to be sufficiently ensured when the car buffer 21 is compressed by the car 7.

The car stopper detection switch 24 is connected to the controller 11.

A pattern P2 in a broken line, which has a maximum speed of V2, represents an overspeed pattern for the normal operation. A pattern P3 in a solid line, which has a maximum speed of V3, represents a running speed pattern when the maintenance operation of the car 7 is performed from the top terminal landing<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> to the bottom terminal landing.
