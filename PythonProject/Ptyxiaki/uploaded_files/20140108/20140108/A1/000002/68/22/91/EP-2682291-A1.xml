However, there are an increasing number of types of vehicles in which it is difficult to utilize the internal combustion engine as a heat source for air-conditioning (temperature regulation) of the compartment. Such vehicles include an electric vehicle that does not have the internal combustion engine but only has a motor as a drive source, and a hybrid vehicle that has a motor and an internal combustion engine as drive sources, and frequently stops the internal combustion engine.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">From the circumstance described above, it is considered that a Peltier element described in Patent Document 1 may be used for air-conditioning of a passenger compartment, for example. A Peltier element includes a cooling portion absorbing heat and a heating portion discharging heat. The cooling portion and the heating portion can be interchanged by inversing the polarity of an electrode. When an air-conditioning apparatus is used to decrease the temperature of the passenger compartment for cooling, air sent into the passenger compartment is cooled by the cooling portion of the Peltier element. On the other hand, when the air-conditioning apparatus is used to increase the temperature of the passenger compartment for warming, the polarity of the electrode on the Peltier element is inversed from the polarity for cooling, whereby the air sent into the passenger compartment is heated by the heating portion of the Peltier element.</p><heading id="h0003">PRIOR ART DOCUMENT</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Document</heading><heading id="h0005">Patent Document 1</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP10035268A"><text>10-35268</text></patcit> (paragraphs [0012] to [0014], <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>)</p><heading id="h0006">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0007">Problems that the Invention is to Solve</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">When a Peltier element is used for air-conditioning of the passenger compartment as described above, the air-conditioning (warming) of the passenger compartment is possible even in a vehicle in which it is difficult to utilize the internal combustion as a heat source for air-conditioning of the passenger compartment.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">However, to obtain the structure of an air-conditioning apparatus using a Peltier element, significant changes must be made to the structure of a conventional air-conditioning apparatus that cools air sent to a passenger compartment by a cooling device and heats the air by utilizing heat of the internal combustion engine. When the structure of the air-conditioning apparatus is significantly changed, a conventional facility cannot be used for producing the apparatus. Therefore, a facility for producing the apparatus has to be remodeled. Since the facility for producing the apparatus has to be remodeled, costs for producing the air-conditioning apparatus are increased.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">It has therefore been desired that air-conditioning of a passenger compartment be done (the passenger compartment be warmed) in a vehicle in which it is difficult to use an internal combustion engine as a heat source for the air-conditioning of the passenger compartment, while<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> utilizing a conventional air-conditioning apparatus that cools air sent to the passenger compartment by a cooling device and heats the air by utilizing the heat of the internal combustion engine.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Accordingly, it is an objective of the present invention to provide a vehicle air-conditioning apparatus that performs air-conditioning of a passenger compartment without entailing a significant change in the structure in a vehicle in which it is difficult to use an internal combustion engine as a heat source for the air-conditioning of the passenger compartment.</p><heading id="h0008">Means for Solving the Problems</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">In order to achieve the foregoing object, in a vehicle air-conditioning apparatus according to the present invention, upon cooling or heating air sent to the passenger compartment for adjusting a temperature in the passenger compartment, the air is cooled by a cooling device, and the air is heated by a Peltier element. One mounted in a conventional air-conditioning apparatus can be used as the cooling device. Therefore, the significant change in the structure of the air-conditioning apparatus is avoided. Even in a vehicle in which it is difficult to use the internal combustion engine as a heat source for the air-conditioning of the passenger compartment, air sent to the passenger compartment can be heated by a Peltier element. Therefore, the air-conditioning of the passenger compartment can be done (the passenger compartment can be warmed). Accordingly, an air-conditioning of the passenger compartment can be done without entailing a significant change in the structure in a vehicle in which it is difficult to use the internal combustion engine as a heat source for the air-conditioning of the passenger compartment.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The conventional air-conditioning apparatus includes a circulation circuit for circulating coolant performing heat transfer with an internal combustion engine mounted on a vehicle, and air sent to the passenger compartment is heated by the coolant. Therefore, a vehicle having an internal combustion engine can employ a method for heating the coolant in the circulation circuit by the heating portion of a Peltier element and heating the air sent to the passenger compartment through the heated coolant, as a method for heating the air by the Peltier element. In this case, the air sent to the passenger compartment can be heated by the Peltier element by utilizing the circulation circuit mounted in the conventional air-conditioning apparatus. Accordingly, the significant change in the structure of the air-conditioning apparatus from the conventional structure can be avoided. When the internal combustion engine is operated to generate heat, this heat can be collected by the coolant circulating in the circulation circuit, and can be utilized for the air-conditioning of the passenger compartment (for warming the passenger compartment).</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the circulation circuit includes a first path that allows the coolant circulating in the circulation circuit to pass through the internal combustion engine and a second path that allows the coolant to bypass the internal combustion engine. Either one of the first path and the second path is used as a path for circulating the coolant. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the circulation circuit includes a first path that allows the coolant circulating in the circulation circuit to pass through the internal combustion engine and a second path that allows the coolant to bypass the internal combustion engine. Either one of the first path and the second path is used as a path for circulating the coolant. In this case, the second path can be selected as the path for circulating the coolant in the circulation circuit, when the internal combustion engine generates a small amount of heat. On the other hand, the first path can be selected when the internal combustion engine generates a large amount of heat. If the second path is selected as the path for circulating the coolant in<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> the circulation circuit as described above when the internal combustion engine generates a small amount of heat, the heat of the coolant heated by the heating portion of the Peltier element cannot be drawn by the internal combustion engine. Therefore, the coolant is effectively heated by the heating portion of the Peltier element. If the first path is selected as the path for circulating the coolant in the circulation circuit as described above when the internal combustion engine generates a large amount of heat, the coolant can be heated by the heating portion of the Peltier element. Therefore, the application of heat to the coolant by the heating portion of the Peltier element can be stopped, or the amount of heat for heating the coolant can be reduced.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, the circulation circuit includes a radiator. When the temperature of the coolant circulating in the circulation circuit is greater than or equal to a predetermined determination value, the radiator allows to flow therein to perform heat transfer between the coolant and ambient air. The Peltier element includes a cooling portion that performs heat transfer with the coolant circulating in a coolant circuit. The coolant circuit guides the coolant circulating therein to the radiator and performs heat transfer between the coolant and ambient air at the radiator. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the circulation circuit includes a radiator. When the temperature of the coolant circulating in the circulation circuit is greater than or equal to a predetermined determination value, the radiator allows coolant to flow therein to perform heat transfer between the coolant and ambient air. The Peltier element includes a cooling portion that performs heat transfer with the coolant circulating in a coolant circuit. The coolant circuit guides the coolant circulating therein to the radiator and performs heat transfer between the coolant and ambient air at the radiator. The heat transfer described above prevents an excessive temperature drop of the coolant in the coolant circuit. Therefore, an excessive temperature drop of the cooling portion of the Peltier element performing the heat transfer with the coolant is also prevented. When the heating portion performs the heating operation, heat is transferred from the cooling portion to the heating portion of the Peltier element. Therefore, in the Peltier element, the heat is more efficiently transferred from the cooling portion to the heating portion; in other words, the coolant is more efficiently heated by the heating portion as the temperature difference between the cooling portion and the heating portion becomes smaller. Since a temperature drop of the cooling portion of the Peltier element is prevented as described above, the temperature difference between the heating portion and the cooling portion of the Peltier element is reduced, and the heating portion of the Peltier element efficiently heats the coolant.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the Peltier element includes a cooling portion that performs heat transfer with the coolant circulating in the coolant circuit for cooling an electric device mounted on a vehicle. When the heating portion performs heating operation, heat is transferred from the cooling portion to the heating portion of the Peltier element. Therefore, the temperature of the cooling portion decreases. When the coolant having the decreased temperature due to the heat transfer between the cooling portion of the Peltier element and the coolant in the coolant circuit is used for cooling the electric device, the electric device is effectively cooled. Since the coolant receives heat from the electric device, an excessive temperature drop of the coolant in the coolant circuit is prevented. Therefore, an excessive temperature drop of the cooling portion of the Peltier element is also prevented. In the Peltier element, the heat is more efficiently transferred from the cooling portion to the heating portion.

Accordingly,<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> when a temperature drop of the cooling portion of the Peltier element is prevented as described above, the temperature difference between the heating portion and the cooling portion of the Peltier element is reduced. As a result, the heating operation by the heating portion of the Peltier element is efficiently performed.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the coolant circuit includes a heat exchanger that allows the coolant circulating in the coolant circuit to flow therein for performing heat transfer between the coolant and ambient air. This structure prevents an excessive temperature drop of the coolant due to the heat transfer between the coolant and ambient air by the heat exchanger in the coolant circuit, when a temperature drop of the coolant cannot be prevented only by the heat from the electric device under the condition in which the coolant in the coolant circuit is cooled by the cooling portion of the Peltier element. Accordingly, an excessive temperature drop of the cooling portion of the Peltier element, which performs heat transfer with the coolant, is also prevented. When a temperature drop of the cooling portion of the Peltier element is prevented as described above, the temperature difference between the heating portion and the cooling portion of the Peltier element is reduced. As a result, the heating operation by the heating portion of the Peltier element is efficiently performed.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the vehicle air-conditioning apparatus includes a control unit that switches the path for circulating the coolant in the circulation circuit to the second path, and allows the heating portion of the Peltier element to perform heating operation, when the passenger compartment is warmed during when the vehicle runs with the internal combustion engine being stopped. When the passenger compartment is warmed during when the vehicle runs with the internal combustion engine being operated, the control unit switches the path for circulating the coolant in the circulation circuit to the first path, and stops the heating operation by the heating portion of the Peltier element. If the second path is selected as described above as the path for circulating the coolant in the circulation circuit when the passenger compartment is warmed during when the vehicle runs with the internal combustion engine being stopped, the heat of the coolant heated by the heating portion of the Peltier element is not removed by the internal combustion engine. Accordingly, the coolant is effectively heated by the heating portion of the Peltier element. If the first path is selected as described above as the path for circulating the coolant in the circulation circuit when the passenger compartment is warmed during when the vehicle runs with the internal combustion engine being operated, the coolant is heated by the internal combustion engine, although the coolant is not heated by the heating portion of the Peltier element. Accordingly, the heating operation of the heating portion of the Peltier element is stopped, and unnecessary operation of the Peltier element is avoided.</p><heading id="h0009">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0016" num="0016"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating an entire air-conditioning apparatus according to a first embodiment;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a first mode in the air-conditioning apparatus of the first embodiment;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a second mode in the air-conditioning apparatus of the first embodiment;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a third mode in the air-conditioning apparatus of the first embodiment;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 5</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a fourth mode in the air-conditioning apparatus<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> of the first embodiment;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">Fig. 6</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a fifth mode in the air-conditioning apparatus of the first embodiment;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 7</figref> is a flowchart illustrating a procedure of an air-conditioning of a passenger compartment;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 8</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating an entire air-conditioning apparatus according to a second embodiment;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 9</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a first mode in the air-conditioning apparatus of the second embodiment;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0010">Fig. 10</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a second mode in the air-conditioning apparatus of the second embodiment;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0011">Fig. 11</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a third mode in the air-conditioning apparatus of the second embodiment;</li><li><figref idrefs="f0012">Fig. 12</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a fourth mode in the air-conditioning apparatus of the second embodiment; and</li><li><figref idrefs="f0013">Fig. 13</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a fifth mode in the air-conditioning apparatus of the second embodiment.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0010">MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0011">[First Embodiment]</heading><p id="p0017" num="0017">An air-conditioning apparatus for a hybrid vehicle according to a first embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005 f0006 f0007">Figs. 1 to 7</figref>.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The hybrid vehicle includes, as drive sources, a motor generator and an internal combustion engine, and switches the drive source to be used according to a driving condition or driving requirement.

With this structure, in the air-conditioning apparatus described above, when the compressor 3 in the cooling device 2 is driven to circulate the refrigerant, the low-temperature refrigerant passes through the evaporator 6 to cool the air sent to the passenger compartment 1 by the refrigerant.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The air-conditioning apparatus is provided with a circulation circuit 8, which circulates coolant performing heat transfer with the internal combustion engine 7, and heats the air sent to the passenger compartment 1 by the coolant. The circulation circuit 8 includes an electric pump 9 for circulating the coolant in the circulation circuit 8, and a heater core 10 that performs heat transfer between the coolant in the circulation circuit 8 and the air sent to the passenger compartment 1 in order to heat the air by the coolant. The circulation circuit 8 also includes a first path 8a that forms the passage of the coolant, circulating in the circulation circuit, in the internal combustion engine 7, a second path 8b that forms a bypass of the coolant from the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> internal combustion engine 7, and a changeover valve 11 that changes the path for circulating the coolant in the circulation circuit 8 to the first path 8a or to the second path 8b. With the switching operation of the changeover valve 11, either one of the first path 8a and the second path 8b is used as a path for circulating the coolant in the circulation circuit 8. When the internal combustion engine 7 generates heat during when the coolant circulates in the circulation circuit 8 through the first path 8a, the coolant receives heat from the internal combustion engine 7, so that the temperature of the coolant increases.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The first path 8a includes a radiator 12 that performs heat transfer between the coolant and ambient air, and a thermostat 13 that inhibits or allows the passage of the coolant in the radiator 12 based upon the temperature of the coolant in the first path 8a. The thermostat 13 inhibits the passage of the coolant through the radiator 12 when the temperature of the first path 8a is less than a determination value set beforehand. On the other hand, the thermostat 13 allows the passage of the coolant through the radiator 12 when the temperature of the coolant is higher than or equal to the determination value. Accordingly, when the temperature of the coolant is higher than or equal to the determination value during the circulation in the circulation circuit 8 through the first path 8a, the coolant is caused to flow into the radiator 12. The heat transfer between the coolant and ambient air is done in the radiator 12, whereby the coolant is cooled. Thus, an excessive temperature rise of the coolant is prevented.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The circulation circuit 8 is provided with a passage 14 connecting an upstream side and a downstream side of the heater core 10, and a shutoff valve 15 that can shut the circulation through the heater core 10 from the circulation circuit 8. The shutoff valve 15 makes the switching operation in order to allow the coolant to selectively flow through the heater core 10 or the passage 14. When the coolant is caused to flow into the passage 14 by the switching operation of the shutoff valve 15, the coolant does not flow into the heater core 10. Therefore, the heater core 10 is in the state of being shut off from the circulation circuit 8 for the circulation of the coolant. On the other hand, when the switching operation of the shutoff valve 15 is done in order to inhibit the circulation of the coolant in the passage 14, the coolant is caused to flow into the heater core 10. Therefore, the shutoff state of the heater core 10 to the circulation circuit 8 is canceled. Accordingly, when the temperature of the coolant circulating in the circulation circuit 8 is high, the shutoff state of the heater core 10 to the circulation circuit 8 is canceled to cause the coolant to flow into the heater core 10. Thus, the air sent to the passenger compartment 1 is heated by the coolant.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The temperature regulation in the passenger compartment 1 by the air-conditioning apparatus is realized by cooling the air sent to the passenger compartment 1 by the evaporator 6 of the cooling device 2, or by heating the air by the heater core 10 in the circulation circuit 8. The temperature of the coolant passing through the heater core 10 in the circulation circuit 8 increases in receipt of the heat from the internal combustion engine 7. Therefore, the air sent to the compartment 1 is heated by utilizing the heat from the internal combustion engine 7. However, in the hybrid vehicle, the operation of the internal combustion engine 7 frequently stops during the driving by use of the motor generator. Under this condition, it is difficult to use the internal combustion engine 7 as the heat source for adjusting the temperature (for the air-conditioning) of the passenger compartment 1.

The coolant heated by the heating portion 16a of the Peltier element 16 heats the air sent to the passenger compartment 1 when passing through the heater core 10.

In this case, the temperature decreases in the cooling portion 16b of the Peltier element 16. The coolant having the decreased temperature due to the heat transfer between the cooling portion 16b and the coolant in the coolant circuit 17 is used to cool the electric devices (the motor generator 21, the electronic device 22). On the other hand, the coolant circulating in the coolant circuit 17 receives heat from the electric devices, so that an excessive temperature drop of the coolant is prevented.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">The present embodiment achieves the advantages described below.
<ul><li>(5) Even if the coolant in the coolant circuit 17 is cooled by the cooling portion 16b due to a temperature drop of the cooling portion 16b of the Peltier element 16 in the first mode and the fourth mode of the air-conditioning apparatus, an excessive temperature drop of the coolant is prevented, since the coolant receives heat from the electric devices. Therefore, an excessive temperature drop of the cooling portion 16b of the Peltier element 16, which performs the heat transfer with the coolant, is also prevented. The temperature difference between the heating portion 16a and the cooling portion 16b of the Peltier element 16 is reduced by the inhibition of a temperature drop of the cooling portion 16b, whereby the coolant is efficiently heated by the heating portion 16a of the Peltier element 16.</li><li>(6) When a temperature drop of the coolant in the coolant circuit 17 cannot be prevented only by the heat from the electric devices under the condition in which the coolant in the coolant circuit 17 is cooled by the cooling portion 16b of the Peltier element 16, an excessive temperature drop of the coolant is prevented by the heat transfer between the coolant and the ambient air in the heat exchanger 23 in the coolant circuit 17. Therefore, an excessive temperature drop of the cooling portion 16b of the Peltier element 16, which performs the heat<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> transfer with the coolant, is also prevented. Even in the case where a temperature drop of the coolant in the coolant circuit 17 cannot be prevented only by the heat from the electric devices, the temperature difference between the heating portion 16a and the cooling portion 16b of the Peltier element 16 is reduced, whereby the coolant in the circulation circuit 8 is efficiently heated by the heating portion 16a of the Peltier element 16.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0018">[Other Embodiments]</heading><p id="p0055" num="0055">The respective embodiments described above may be modified as described below.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">In the first and second embodiments, the coolant in the circulation circuit 8 may be supplementally heated by the Peltier element 16 in the second mode or in the fifth mode.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">In the first and second embodiments, the second path 8b and the changeover valve 11 in the circulation circuit 8 may be removed in order that the coolant circulating in the circulation circuit 8 always passes through the internal combustion engine 7.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">In the first and second embodiments, the cooling portion 16b of the Peltier element 16 does not always have to perform heat transfer with the coolant in the coolant circuit 17.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">In the first and second embodiments, the air sent to the passenger compartment 1 may directly be heated by the heating portion 16a of the Peltier element 16.</p><heading id="h0019">Description of the Reference Numerals</heading><p id="p0060" num="0060"><dl id="dl0001" compact="compact"><dt>1</dt><dd>Passenger compartment</dd><dt>2</dt><dd>Cooling device</dd><dt>3</dt><dd>Compressor</dd><dt>4</dt><dd>Condenser</dd><dt>5</dt><dd>Expansion valve</dd><dt>6</dt><dd>Evaporator</dd><dt>7</dt><dd>Internal combustion engine</dd><dt>8</dt><dd>Circulation circuit</dd><dt>9</dt><dd>Pump</dd><dt>10</dt><dd>Heater core</dd><dt>8a</dt><dd>First path</dd><dt>8b</dt><dd>Second path</dd><dt>11</dt><dd>Changeover valve</dd><dt>12</dt><dd>Radiator</dd><dt>13</dt><dd>Thermostat</dd><dt>14</dt><dd>Passage</dd><dt>15</dt><dd>Shutoff valve</dd><dt>16</dt><dd>Peltier element</dd><dt>16a</dt><dd>Heating portion</dd><dt>16b</dt><dd>Cooling portion</dd><dt>17</dt><dd>Coolant circuit</dd><dt>18</dt><dd>Pump</dd><dt>19</dt><dd>Control valve</dd><dt>20</dt><dd>Electronic control device</dd><dt>21</dt><dd>Motor generator</dd><dt>22</dt><dd>Electronic device</dd><dt>23</dt><dd>Heat exchanger</dd></dl></p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56983022" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A vehicle air-conditioning apparatus for adjusting a temperature in a passenger compartment by cooling or heating air sent to the passenger compartment, the vehicle air-conditioning apparatus comprising:
