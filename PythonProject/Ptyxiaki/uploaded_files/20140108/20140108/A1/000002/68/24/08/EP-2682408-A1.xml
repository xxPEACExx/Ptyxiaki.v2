It is a polysaccharide that is mainly composed of [beta]-D-gluco-pyranose units linked by 1-4 glycosidic bonds. From a structural perspective, cellulosic chains are arranged into microfibrils during crystallization with the formation of chain-stiffening inter-molecular hydrogen bonds. Different crystalline allomorphs of cellulose are known.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The hydroxyl groups in cellulosic substrates are involved in a number of intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds and generally show limited reactivity as nucleophilic moieties. As a consequence, chemical derivatization of these hydroxyl groups is extremely difficult. Even towards highly reactive molecules (such as e.g. isocyanates), these hydroxyl groups show no or very little reactivity. Another disadvantage of these cellulosic materials is their high melting point, usually higher than the thermal decomposition temperature, which limits their derivatization potential in liquid phase.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Traditional approaches in chemical derivatization of cellulose make use of chemically and/or physically harsh conditions (chemicals, temperature, pressure, pH, ...) to dissolve or derivatize cellulose. This impacts the bulk structure and related properties (such as crystallinity) of the substrates. These current solutions have mainly focused on decreasing or eliminating the hydrogen bonding pattern in the cellulosic substrate, as discussed below.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Sometimes, the problem is merely ignored. In these cases, the cellulose may act as a nonreactive 'filler'.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">One option is to alkoxylate the cellulosic substrate in order to increase its solubility and compatibility with the derivatization agent. Alkoxylation impacts crystallinity, adds capital costs and moreover, is associated with EHS risks.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Another possibility is the use of mono-, di- and/or oligosaccharides which possess different solubility characteristics. However, such use is limited in some applications when the bulk properties of the cellulosic substrates are required (e.g. composites).</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Another option is to break down the hydrogen bonding network.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Frequently applied methods chemically digest the cellulosic substrates by sulfite or alkali processes (caustic soda, dilute NaOH) at elevated temperatures in pressure vessels (degradation, lower molecular weight, decreased crystallinity). However, the aqueous medium or residual moisture, which is often bound into the hydrogen network, is incompatible with isocyanate chemistry and causes side reactions. In addition, residues of the digesting medium (e.g. Na and/or K cations) can be released and can cause side reactions with isocyanates (e.g. isocyanurates). Furthermore, the degradation of the structure leads to a deterioration of the cellulosic properties.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The hydrogen bond network may also be partially or completely destroyed by using mechanical treatments (for example: grinding, milling, etc), wherein mechanical energy may tear apart the microfibrils in order to degrade the cellulosic substrate. This leads to a reduced molecular weight and higher amorphous content. However, mechanical treatments damage the cellulosic bulk structure, which in turn may negatively affect molecular weight, fiber strength and stiffness, etc.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Alternatively, steam explosion can be applied to break down the cellulosic substrate in harsh pressure and temperature conditions. This procedure requires an extra drying step and, in addition, is known to reduce the crystalline content of the substrates.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Therefore, there remains a need for processes for preparing functionalized polysaccharides that overcome one or more of the aforementioned issues. It is an object of the present invention to provide a functionalized polysaccharide. It is also an object of the invention to provide a functionalized polysaccharide while maintaining, or only minimally reducing, the polysaccharide bulk properties, such as crystallinity. It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for preparing a functionalized polysaccharide.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The present inventors have now surprisingly found that one or more of these objects can be obtained by a polysaccharide derivative according to the invention. The polysaccharide derivative can be obtained by pre-contacting the polysaccharide with a compound, before adding an isocyanate for functionalization, said pre-contacting step being performed at a temperature of at most 70°C. The polysaccharide derivative can comprise pendant free isocyanate groups which enable the polysaccharide to be further derivatized, and/or to improve the compatibility of the polysaccharide particles with isocyanate based liquids. The polysaccharide derivatives can subsequently be used in different applications by further reaction/derivatization with other isocyanate-reactive functionalities, such as substrates, specialty chemicals, and polyurethane components.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">According to a first aspect of the present invention, a polysaccharide derivative is provided comprising the reaction product of:
