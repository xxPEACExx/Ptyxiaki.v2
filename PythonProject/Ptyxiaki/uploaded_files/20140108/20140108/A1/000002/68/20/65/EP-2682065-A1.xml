More particularly, the present disclosure is directed to enhancing and/or maintaining a crest factor of a radiofrequency (RF) waveform in electrosurgical generators.</p><heading id="h0004"><i>Background of Related Art</i></heading><p id="p0003" num="0003">Energy-based tissue treatment is well known in the art. Various types of energy (e.g., electrical, ultrasonic, microwave, cryo, heat, laser, etc.) are applied to tissue to achieve a desired result. Electrosurgery involves application of high radio frequency electrical current to a surgical site to cut, ablate, coagulate or seal tissue. In monopolar<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> electrosurgery, a source or active electrode delivers radio frequency energy from the electrosurgical generator to the tissue and a return electrode carries the current back to the generator. In monopolar electrosurgery, the source electrode is typically part of the surgical instrument held by the surgeon and applied to the tissue to be treated. A patient return electrode is placed remotely from the active electrode to carry the current back to the generator.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Ablation is most commonly a monopolar procedure that is particularly useful in the field of cancer treatment, where one or more RF ablation needle electrodes (usually of elongated cylindrical geometry) are inserted into a living body. A typical form of such needle electrodes incorporates an insulated sheath from which an exposed (uninsulated) tip extends. When RF energy is provided between the return electrode and the inserted ablation electrode, RF current flows from the needle electrode through the body. Typically, the current density is very high near the tip of the needle electrode, which tends to heat and destroy surrounding issue.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In bipolar electrosurgery, one of the electrodes of the hand-held instrument functions as the active electrode and the other as the return electrode. The return electrode is placed in close proximity to the active electrode such that an electrical circuit is formed between the two electrodes (e.g., electrosurgical forceps). In this manner, the applied electrical current is limited to the body tissue positioned between the electrodes. When the electrodes are sufficiently separated from one another, the electrical circuit is open and thus inadvertent contact with body tissue with either of the separated electrodes does not cause current to flow.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">It is known in the art that the crest factor of a waveform is a useful measure of the coagulating ability of a radio frequency output. Thus, maintaining a high crest factor would be beneficial in electrosurgical procedures.</p><heading id="h0005"><b><u>SUMMARY</u></b></heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">The present disclosure relates to an electrosurgical generator which includes a controller configured to generate a first pulse train having at least one first control pulse and at least one first reset pulse.

The first and second control pulses are asynchronous and the reset pulses are synchronous. The electrosurgical generator also includes an RF output stage which includes a first switching element and a second switching element. The first control pulse and the second control pulse are configured to activate the first switching element and second switching element, asynchronously, to generate a non-continuous RF waveform. Also, the first reset pulse and the second reset pulse are configured to synchronously activate the first and second switching elements, respectively, to reset the RF output stage.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">A method for performing electrosurgery includes the step of generating a first pulse train, which includes a first control pulse and a first reset pulse. The method also includes the step of generating a second pulse train, which includes a second control pulse and a second reset pulse.

The method also includes the step of activating<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> the first and second switching elements asynchronously to generate a non-continuous RF waveform in response to the asynchronous first and second control pulses, The method may further include the step of activating first and second switching elements synchronously to reset the RF output stage in response to the at least one first reset pulse and at least one second reset pulse.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Another embodiment of the present disclosure includes a method for performing electrosurgery which includes the steps of: setting a desired crest factor for a non-continuous RF waveform; determining an actual crest factor of a non-continuous RF waveform, comparing the desired crest factor with the actual crest factor, and performing an adjustment of a property of a first reset pulse and a property of a second reset pulse to maintain a desired crest factor.

In the following description, well-known functions or constructions are not described in detail to avoid obscuring the present disclosure in unnecessary detail.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The electrosurgical generator, according to the present disclosure, can perform monopolar and bipolar electrosurgical procedures, including vessel sealing procedures. The generator may include a plurality of outputs for interfacing with various electrosurgical instruments (e.g., a monopolar active electrode, return electrode, bipolar electrosurgical forceps, footswitch, etc.). Further, the generator includes electronic circuitry configured for generating radio frequency power specifically suited for various electrosurgical modes (e.g., cutting, blending, division, etc.) and procedures (e.g., monopolar, bipolar, vessel sealing).</p><p id="p0013" num="0013"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1A</figref> is a schematic illustration of a monopolar electrosurgical system 1 according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. The system 1 includes an electrosurgical instrument 2 having one or more electrodes for treating tissue of a patient P. The instrument 2 is a monopolar type instrument including one or more active electrodes (e.g., electrosurgical cutting probe, ablation electrode(s), etc.). Electrosurgical RF energy is supplied to the instrument 2 by a generator 20 via an supply line 4, which is connected to an active terminal 30 (<figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>) of the generator 20, allowing the instrument 2 to coagulate, seal, ablate and/or otherwise treat tissue. The energy is returned to the generator 20 through a return electrode 6 via a return line 8 at a return terminal 32 (<figref idrefs="f0002">Fig.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> 2</figref>) of the generator 20. The active terminal 30 and the return terminal 32 are connectors configured to interface with plugs (not explicitly shown) of the instrument 2 and the return electrode 6, respectively, which are disposed at the ends of the supply line 4 and the return line 8.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The system 1 may include a plurality of return electrodes 6 that are arranged to minimize the chances of tissue damage by maximizing the overall contact area with the patient P. In addition, the generator 20 and the return electrode 6 may be configured for monitoring so-called "tissue-to-patient" contact to insure that sufficient contact exists therebetween to further minimize chances of tissue damage.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1B</figref> is a schematic illustration of a bipolar electrosurgical system 3 according to the present disclosure. The system 3 includes a bipolar electrosurgical forceps 10 having one or more electrodes for treating tissue of a patient P. The electrosurgical forceps 10 includes opposing jaw members having an active electrode 14 and a return electrode 16 disposed therein. The active electrode 14 and the return electrode 16 are connected to the generator 20 through cable 18, which includes the supply and return lines 4, 8 coupled to the active and return terminals 30, 32, respectively (<figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>). The electrosurgical forceps 10 is coupled to the generator 20 at a connector 21 having connections to the active and return terminals 30 and 32 (e.g., pins) via a plug disposed at the end of the cable 18, wherein the plug includes contacts from the supply and return lines 4, 8.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The generator 20 includes suitable input controls (e.g., buttons, activators, switches, touch screen, etc.) for controlling the generator 20. In addition, the generator<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> 20 may include one or more display screens for providing the user with variety of output information (e.g., intensity settings, treatment complete indicators, etc.). The controls allow the user to adjust power of the RF energy, waveform, and other parameters to achieve the desired waveform suitable for a particular task (e.g., coagulating, tissue sealing, intensity setting, etc.). The instrument 2 may also include a plurality of input controls that may be redundant with certain input controls of the generator 20. Placing the input controls at the instrument 2 allows for easier and faster modification of RF energy parameters during the surgical procedure without requiring interaction with the generator 20.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a schematic block diagram of the generator 20 according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. The generator 20 includes a controller 24, a high voltage DC power supply 27 (HVPS) and an RF output stage 28. The controller 24 includes a power supply (not shown), for example, a low voltage DC power supply, which provides low voltage power to circuitry of the controller 24 and/or RF output stage 28. The HVPS 27 is connected to a conventional AC source (e.g., electrical wall outlet) and provides high voltage DC power to an RF output stage 28, which then converts high voltage DC power into RF energy and delivers the RF energy to the active terminal 30. The energy is returned thereto via the return terminal 32.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In particular, the RF output stage 28 generates sinusoidal waveforms of high RF energy. The RF output stage 28 is configured to generate a plurality of waveforms having various duty cycles, peak voltages, crest factors, and other suitable parameters. Certain types of waveforms are suitable for specific electrosurgical modes. For instance, the RF output stage 28 generates a 100% duty cycle sinusoidal waveform in cut mode,<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> which is best suited for ablating, fusing and dissecting tissue and a 1-25% duty cycle waveform in coagulation mode, which is best used for cauterizing tissue to stop bleeding.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The generator 20 may include a plurality of connectors to accommodate various types of electrosurgical instruments (e.g., instrument 2, electrosurgical forceps 10, etc.). Further, the generator 20 is configured to operate in a variety of modes such as ablation, monopolar and bipolar cutting coagulation, etc. It is envisioned that the generator 20 may include a switching mechanism (e.g., relays) to switch the supply of RF energy between the connectors, such that, for instance, when the instrument 2 is connected to the generator 20, only the monopolar plug receives RF energy.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The controller 24 includes a microprocessor 25 operably connected to a memory 26, which may be volatile type memory (e.g., RAM) and/or non-volatile type memory (e.g., flash media, disk media, etc.). The microprocessor 25 includes an output port that is operably connected to the HVPS 27 and/or RF output stage 28 allowing the microprocessor 25 to control the output of the generator 20 according to either open and/or closed control loop schemes. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the microprocessor 25 may be substituted by any logic processor (e.g., control circuit) adapted to perform the calculations discussed herein.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">A closed loop control scheme is a feedback control loop wherein sensor circuit 22 and/or crest factor detection circuit 23, which both may include a plurality of sensors measuring a variety of tissue and energy properties (e.g., tissue impedance, tissue temperature, output current and/or voltage, crest factor, etc.), provide feedback to the controller 24. Such sensors are within the purview of those skilled in the art. The<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> controller 24 then signals the HVPS 27 and/or RF output stage 28, which then adjust DC and/or RF power supply, respectively. The controller 24 also receives input signals from the input controls of the generator 20 or the instrument 2. The controller 24 utilizes the input signals to adjust power outputted by the generator 20 and/or performs other control functions thereon.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref> depicts a schematic diagram of the RF output stage 28 having a transformer 40. In one embodiment, transformer 40 is a non-single ended transformer, configured in a simplified push-pull topology. It is also envisioned the present system and method may be applied to any non-single ended transformer topology (e.g., full bridge) having a primary winding 41 and secondary winding 43.

The switching elements 42 and 44 are coupled to the controller 24 which controls the operation thereof to generate RF energy. More specifically, the controller 24 is configured to transmit a low-voltage clock signal of a first pulse train 60 to switching element 42 and a second pulse train 62 to switching element 44 of the RF output stage 28 (shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 6</figref>).

In one embodiment, a control loop may be configured to measure the crest factor of a waveform and maintain the crest factor at a desired level. Crest factor is a useful measurement of<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> the coagulation ability of an RF output waveform, thus increasing or controlling the crest factor is beneficial to electrosurgical procedures involving coagulation.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The present disclosure provides a system and method for maintaining a desired crest factor of an RF waveform. A high crest factor waveform is particularly helpful in electrosurgical procedures. The crest factor is defined as the ratio of the peak voltage and root mean square (RMS) voltage for symmetrical waveforms, those having a 100% duty cycle (e.g., when there is no interruption or pause in the RF waveform). <maths id="math0001" num="(1)"><math display="block"><mi>CF</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">V</mi><mi>PEAK</mi></msub><mo>/</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">V</mi><mi>RMS</mi></msub></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="51" he="9" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths></p><p id="p0025" num="0025">For non-symmetrical waveforms, the crest factor is defined as the ratio of peak to peak voltage and twice the RMS voltage. <maths id="math0002" num="(2)"><math display="block"><mi>CF</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">V</mi><mfenced separators=""><mi>PEAK</mi><mo>-</mo><mi>PEAK</mi></mfenced></msub><mo>/</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">2</mn><mo>*</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">V</mi><mi>RMS</mi></msub></math><img id="ib0002" file="imgb0002.tif" wi="61" he="10" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths></p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Electrosurgical generators have difficulties generating high crest factor waveforms primarily due to excessive ringing, during the off-time or pause stage. The ringing in the RF waveform is especially excessive in high impedance loads. This occurs due to an increase in the RMS of the waveform and which decreases the crest factor, as seen in the above formula (2). When the undesired ringing is removed, the RMS of the waveform is decreased, thus increasing the crest factor (e.g., maintaining the crest factor).</p><p id="p0027" num="0027"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a schematic diagram of a plurality of pulse trains and a corresponding 100% duty cycle RF waveform. As mentioned above, the controller 24 is configured to transmit a low-voltage clock signal sourced from the low-voltage power supply (not shown), as a first pulse train 60 to switching element 42 and a second pulse<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> train 62 to switching element 44 of the RF output stage 28. Each of the pulse trains includes a plurality of control pulses 60a and 62a, respectively. When a 100% duty cycle waveform is desired, i.e., when there is no pause or interruption in power (shown in output wave 64 in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref>), the first and second control pulse trains 60a and 62a are non-synchronous and continuous. The RF waveform 64 is generated as the first pulse train 60 and the second pulse train 62 to control the respective switching elements 40 and 42.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">More specifically, the first pulse train 60 activates the pull of the RF output stage 28 when the square wave of the clock signal is at its highest amplitude, namely when the first control pulse 60a activates the switching element 42. The second pulse train 62 activates the push of the RF output stage 28 when the square wave of the clock signal is at its highest amplitude, such that the second control pulse 62a activates the switching element 44. By alternating the first and second control pulses 60a and 62a and spacing the control pulses 60a and 62a at ½ cycle timing (e.g., 180° out of phase), the RF waveform 64 is created at a specified frequency. Further, tuning can be done with inductors and capacitors and/or the parasitics of the transformer 40 to give a sinusoidal output as illustrated in output wave 64 in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref>.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 5</figref> depicts a schematic diagram of a plurality of pulse trains and a less than 100% duty cycle RF waveform output. The waveform 64 has a duty cycle of less than 100%. The first and second control pulses 60a and 62a are out of phase by 180°. In other words, the pulses are staggered, which allows for generation of non-synchronous waveforms. Further, there is a period of time when both the first and second control pulses 60a and 62a are paused to provide for off-time of the waveform. Ringing occurs<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> in a region 66 when the first and second control pulse trains 60a and 62b are paused during the RF waveform off time, hence less than 100% duty cycle.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The region 66 shows the RF waveform 64 decaying steadily due to a pause in pulse trains 60 and 62, i.e., no activity. The region 66 is defined as the region where switching elements 42 and 44 (shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>) do not receive the pulse trains 60 and 62 from the controller 24. Although there is a pause in the pulse trains 60 and 62, there is still sufficient energy stored in the tuning elements of the transformer 40, thus energy rings out. When the control pulse trains 60 and 62 are stopped in the RF output stage 28, ringing occurs in the region 66 of the waveform 64, since stored energy still exists in the circuitry. The ringing in the region 66, in turn, reduces the crest factor in the RF waveform 64, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 5</figref>. In order to maintain a high crest factor waveform output of the electrosurgical unit, the ringing in the waveform 64, shown in region 66 must be decreased and/or eliminated.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates the effect of ringing on non-synchronous waveforms with less than 100% duty cycle. <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 6</figref> shows a graph of a low crest factor RF waveform 50 showing desired and undesired waves according to the present disclosure.

The reset pulses are preferably of substantially the same duration. When the first and second reset pulses 60b and 62b are synchronously and simultaneously transmitted by the controller 24, the non-continuous RF waveform 64 generates substantially no ringing.

It is also envisioned that the duration of the first and second reset pulses 60b and 62b may vary in different electrosurgical procedures and/or different patients.

By adjusting the duty cycle from about 4.6% to about 100%, this, in turn, adjusts the crest factor from about 1.4 to about 8.0.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036"><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a graph of a high crest factor RF waveform 50' showing desired and undesired waves according to the present disclosure.

The excessive ringing is reduced and propagates between undesired waves 56' and 58'. The reduction in the ringing is seen in the undesired waves 56', 58' being substantially similar in size. Unlike the excessive ringing wave region 60, the waves of region 60' are also substantially smaller.

In addition to transmitting a clock frequency of a first pulse train 60 and a second pulse train 62 to the switching elements 42 and 44 of<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> the RF output stage 27, respectively, the controller 24 also transmits a third pulse train 63 to the switching element 48.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038"><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a schematic diagram of a plurality of pulse trains transmitted by the controller 24.
