Recently, a particle beam treatment in which a heavy particle beam such as a proton beam or a carbon beam is irradiated onto the cancer cell has been attracted attention. First of all, the characteristic of a particle beam irradiation in which a particle beam is irradiated to kill a cancer cell will be described. In a case where various kinds of irradiation beams are irradiated onto a human body, the dose distribution of the irradiation beam in the human body changes as shown in <figref idrefs="f0015">FIG.15</figref>. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0015">FIG.15</figref>, among various kinds of irradiations, a photon beam such as an X-ray or a gamma ray, has a relative dose which becomes maximum in a portion close to the surface of the body, and is decreased as the depth from the surface of the body is increased. On the other hand, a particle beam, such as a proton beam or a<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> carbon beam, has a relative dose which has a peak value at a position where the beam stops at a deep portion from the surface of the body, that is, immediately before the range of the particle beam. This peak value is called the Bragg Peak (BP).</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Particle beam cancer treatment is such that this Bragg peak BP is irradiated to a tumor formed in a human organ and the treatment of the cancer is performed. In addition to the cancer, it can also be used for a case where a deep portion of a body is treated. A region to be treated, including a tumor, is generally called an irradiation target. The position of the Bragg peak BP is determined by the energy of an irradiated particle beam, and as the energy of the particle beam becomes higher, the Bragg peak BP is formed at a deeper position. In the particle beam treatment, it is required to provide uniform distribution of dose of a particle beam in whole region of an irradiation target. In order to give the Bragg peak BP to the whole region of the irradiation target, "spread of the irradiation volume" of the particle beam is performed.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">This "spread of the irradiation volume" is performed in three directions of an X-axis, a Y-axis and a Z axis perpendicular to each other. When an irradiation direction of a particle beam is set to be a direction of the Z-axis, "spread of the irradiation volume" is first performed so as to spread the irradiation field in the X-axis and Y-axis directions, and since the irradiation field spread is performed in a lateral direction perpendicular to a depth direction, it is generally called the irradiation field spread. The<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> second "spread of irradiation volume" is performed in the Z-axis, and it is called the irradiation volume spread in a depth direction.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The irradiation volume spread in a depth direction is performed to spread the Bragg peak BP in an irradiation direction of a particle beam to a depth direction since the width of the Bragg peak BP in an irradiation direction of a particle beam is narrow as compared with the extent of an irradiation target in a depth direction. On the other hand, the irradiation field spread in a lateral direction is performed to spread the irradiation field in the Bragg peak BP in a direction perpendicular to an irradiation direction since the diameter of a particle beam, which is accelerated by an accelerator generally, is smaller than the size of an irradiation target in a direction perpendicular to an irradiation direction. With respect to the irradiation volume spread in a depth direction and the irradiation field spread in a lateral direction, various kinds of methods have been proposed so far. Recently, Scanning Irradiation has attracted attention.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In Scanning Irradiation, as an irradiation field spread method in a lateral direction, there is a method in which a deflection electromagnet provided at the upstream portion of a particle beam irradiation part of a particle beam treatment device is used to scan a particle beam in the XY plane, and an irradiation position of the particle beam is moved with the lapse of time to obtain a wide irradiation field. In this method, a uniform dose distribution can be obtained by suitably overlapping adjacent irradiation spots of pencil beams having a small diameter. Scanning<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> methods of a pencil beam include a raster method of performing scanning continuously with respect to time, a spot method of performing a step-like scanning with respect to time and a method combining the raster method and the spot method.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">As the irradiation volume spread method in the depth direction, there is a method in which the energy of a particle beam itself which is irradiated from a particle beam treatment device is controlled. In this method, the energy of a particle beam is controlled by changing the acceleration energy of an accelerator which accelerates the particle beam, or the energy of a particle beam is changed by inserting a tool called a range shifter so as to cross the particle beam. There is also a method in which both the control by the accelerator and the range filter are used.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In the irradiation volume spread method in the depth direction, a particle beam is made to have the energy of specified intensity, after one of irradiation layers of an irradiation target volume is irradiated with the Bragg peak BP, the energy of the particle beam is changed, and next irradiation layer of the irradiation target volume is irradiated with the Bragg peak BP. Such operation is repeated plural times so as for plural irradiation layers to be irradiated with the Bragg peak BP of the particle beam. Consequently, the Spread-out Bragg peak SOBP having a desired width in a beam irradiation direction can be obtained. (For example, Patent Document 1)</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">A particle beam irradiation method which is made by combining the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> irradiation field spread method in a lateral direction and the irradiation volume spread method in a depth direction is called Scanning Irradiation.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Further, a method in which irradiation is performed at the same spot position for plural times with time-wise dividing at each irradiation layer so as to compensate the deviation of irradiation caused by moving of a position of affected site due to a patient's breathing, is proposed(For example, Patent Document 2, <figref idrefs="f0011">FIG.11</figref>). Further, in the Patent Document 2, a technique, for controlling the irradiation dose by synchronizing with a breathing phase in consideration of the moving of an affected site caused by breathing, is also proposed.</p><heading id="h0003">PRIOR ART REFERENCES</heading><heading id="h0004">PATENT DOCUMENT</heading><p id="p0011" num="0011"><ul><li>Patent Document 1 : Patent Application Laid-Open No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO200687649A"><text>2006-87649</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 2 : International Publication of <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO2006082651A"><text>WO2006/082651</text></patcit>(<figref idrefs="f0011">FIG.11</figref>)</li></ul></p><heading id="h0005">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0006">Problems to be solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">In the above-mentioned conventional scanning irradiation method, it is required to change energy of a particle beam for plural times to perform irradiation.

In <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG.3</figref>, for simplification, only one particle beam irradiation part is shown as a particle beam irradiation part 30. For reasons of application of radiation safety management and the like, the particle beam generation part 10, and the particle beam irradiation parts 30A and 30B are installed in individual shielded rooms. The particle beam transport part 20 connects the particle beam generation part 10 to the particle beam irradiation parts 30A and 30B.

The irradiation nozzle 40 shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG.3</figref> has a beam diameter changer 44 for changing a beam diameter of a particle beam PB. As a beam diameter changer, various kinds of changers may be used. The beam diameter changer includes a changer in which a quadrupole electromagnet is used, and a changer in which a thin scatterer is used and a beam diameter in an irradiation target can be changed by changing a thickness of the scatterer. Further, in a case where the beam diameter is not required to change or select, the beam diameter changer 44 may be omitted. The irradiation nozzle 40 comprises deflection electromagnets for scanning 41a and 41b (both of the deflection electromagnets for scanning 41a and 41b may be referred as a deflection electromagnet for scanning 41) which scan a particle beam PB, after whose beam diameter is changed, in the lateral direction, that is, in an X phase and a Y phase which are perpendicular to an irradiation direction of a particle beam PB, a driving power source of a deflection electromagnet for scanning 45 for driving the deflection electromagnet for scanning 41, a dose monitor 42 for monitoring an irradiation dose of a particle beam PB, and a ridge filter 43 which is a energy width expanding device for expanding an energy width of a particle beam PB.

Therefore, as a whole, a particle beam which has passed through the filter has an energy width which is larger than that of a particle beam before which passes through the filter. Consequently, when inside of a body is irradiated with a particle beam which has passed through the ridge filter 43,<br/>
a position of the Bragg Peak (BP), that is, the range of a particle beam is spread. An example of a Spread-out Bragg Peak (SOBP) will be shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG.4</figref>. In <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG.4</figref>, the SOBP has the length of approximately 10 cm. When a ridge filter which forms the SOBP shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG.4</figref> is used, an irradiation target having a width of 10cm in a depth direction can be irradiated.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Next, an operation of a particle beam irradiation system shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG.3</figref> will be explained. First, in a treatment planning part 60, an irradiation dose distribution for each patient is determined and the data are stored. In an irradiation control calculation part 70, based on the data of an irradiation dose distribution, an irradiation dose at each irradiation spot is determined and its data are outputted to an irradiation dose controller 14 of the irradiation control part 80. Further, in the irradiation control calculation part 70, energy of a particle beam which should be extracted by the accelerator 12 and a spot size will be determined and its data will be<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> outputted to the accelerator controller 13 and a spot size controller 15. By performing the above-mentioned, preparation before irradiation will be completed.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Next, <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG.1</figref> shows an image of an irradiation area when an irradiation target is actually irradiated with a particle beam. In <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG.1 (A)</figref>, a circle shows each irradiation spot, and numeral in a circle shows the order of scanning. Further, <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG.1 (B)</figref> is a cross sectional view taken along the line A-A of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG.1 (A)</figref>. <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG.5</figref> is a flow chart showing steps of a particle beam irradiation system when a particle beam is radiated. First, the accelerator 12 and the beam diameter changer 44 are set through the irradiation control part 80 so as for an energy and a spot size which are determined by the irradiation control calculation part 70 in the preparation stage to be a determined value (ST1). Next, in order to radiate a particle beam PB to a position of an irradiation spot 1, the driving power source of a deflection electromagnet for scanning 45 is controlled by a beam scan controller 16 so as to set an exciting current of the deflection electromagnet for scanning 41 (ST2). After setting of the exciting electric current is completed, a particle beam is extracted from the accelerator 12 so as to start irradiation (ST3). When an irradiation is started, an irradiation dose is counted by the dose monitor 42. A dose count value is transmitted to the irradiation dose controller 14.<br/>
In the irradiation dose controller 14, a necessary irradiation dose value at each irradiation spot is received from the irradiation control calculation part 70. When a dose value at every irradiation spot reaches the necessary<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> irradiation dose value, a radiation dosage termination signal is transmitted to the irradiation control calculation part 70 (ST4). When a dose at an irradiation spot reaches a predetermined value, the irradiation control calculation part 70 transmits a command to the beam scan controller 16 so as to move a particle beam to next irradiation spot, and to set an exciting electric current of the deflection electromagnet for scanning 41 to be an exciting electric current corresponding to the next irradiation spot (ST6). The above-mentioned operation will be repeated until an irradiation at a final irradiation spot (an irradiation spot which is indicated by n in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG.1</figref>) is completed.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG.1</figref> shows a area in which irradiation is performed according to the above-mentioned steps. An irradiated area in a lateral direction, that is, in an XY direction is a whole area which is formed by moving an irradiation spot stepwise by the deflection electromagnets for scanning 41, and an irradiated area in a depth direction, that is in a z direction is a area corresponding to Bragg Peak which is spread by an energy of a particle beam which is spread by the ridge filter 43. When a general ridge filter is used, an energy width of a particle beam is the same in an XY whole area. Therefore, in a z direction, an area having a given width is an irradiation area. Consequently, at every irradiation spot, a columnar area is an irradiation area, and whole irradiation area which is made of whole irradiation spots becomes a cylindrical shape area. In a case where a shape of affected site is similar to a rolled-shape, by setting an energy of a particle beam which is extracted from the accelerator 12 and the ridge filter 43 so as to form a spread-out<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> Bragg Peak corresponding to a depth of an affected site, irradiation can be completed without changing energy. In conventional spot scanning irradiation,<br/>
by successively changing an energy of a particle beam to be radiated, whole area is irradiated by forming plural layers of irradiation in a depth direction. According to the above-mentioned method, it is necessary to successively change an energy. In order to change energy, it is necessary to change a parameter of the accelerator 12 or to change a parameter of a range shifter which is inserted after a particle beam is extracted from the accelerator 12. Consequently, it takes time. On the other hand, according to this invention, it is not necessary to change energy of a particle beam, and whole area can be irradiated only by one scanning in an XY direction. Consequently, irradiation time can be shortened; as a result, a burden on a patient can be relieved.</p><heading id="h0012">EMBODIMENT 2</heading><p id="p0025" num="0025"><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG.6</figref> is a block diagram showing an outline of configuration of a particle beam irradiation system according to EMBODIMENT 2 of the present invention.

Since a position of an irradiation target is changed by breathing of a patient, etc., an irradiation position of a particle beam is changed. Consequently, irradiation accuracy is decreased. At the time of exhaling, etc., the degree of change of a position of an irradiation target is small. Therefore, when an irradiation is performed during the period of exhaling, irradiation with high accuracy can be performed.

That is, data of a status signal which are outputted by the displacement phase detecting part 90 are registered in the irradiation control calculation part 70. In the irradiation control calculation part 70, a time length of a status signal in moving an affected site (hereinafter, will be called as one gate length) is evaluated by a plurality of one gate lengths which are registered, for example.<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> Then, an irradiation parameter for radiating whole irradiation spots in an affected site within one gate length such as irradiation dose rate (intensity) at each irradiation spot is determined by performing computing. An irradiation dose rate is obtained by dividing an irradiation dose at each irradiation spot by a permissible irradiation time. The permissible irradiation time is obtained by multiplying an irradiation time in the one gate length by irradiation rate of each spot in whole of irradiation. After an irradiation parameter is determined, irradiation is performed. However, while a status signal SS is outputted (in one gate length), irradiation is performed by using an irradiation parameter which is determined. <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG.8(c)</figref> shows the image in which each irradiation spot is actually irradiated, wherein one gate length is enlarged. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG.8(c)</figref>, a particle beam is radiated so as for all irradiation spots from 1 to n to be irradiated within one gate length. For example, in a case where the number of irradiation spot is evaluated to be 500, and one gate length is evaluated to be one second, when whole irradiation time is 0.5 second, for example, which is less than one gate length, irradiation parameters are determined so as for an irradiation time of one irradiation spot to be approximately 1ms.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Depending on dose of a particle beam which can be extracted from an accelerator 12 and the size of an irradiation target, for example, in a case where, an irradiation target has a size of 5cm x 5cm x 5cm, irradiation dose is 5GyE as a biological dose and a spot size is φ2.5mm, it is practically possible to irradiate necessary dose to all of irradiation spots, whose total number is approximately 500 and whose irradiation time is 0.5 seconds. In this case,<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> by setting a parameter of a ridge filter 43 so as for a width of a SOBP to be 5cm in a predetermined depth, an irradiation in a depth direction of an irradiation target can be realized without changing energy of a particle beam. Consequently, irradiation of all irradiation spots can be completed within one gate. As a result, irradiation can be performed by suppressing movement of an irradiation target during irradiation to the minimum, and irradiation with extremely high accuracy can be realized.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Further, in the above, an example in which necessary irradiation dose can be performed in whole irradiation area within one gate was described, however, necessary dose may not be necessarily irradiated within one gate. For example, in the above-mentioned example, in a case where 5GyE of irradiation dose can not be irradiated to whole irradiation area by using an amount of a particle beam which can be extracted from an accelerator by a single acceleration, 5GyE of irradiation dose can be irradiated to whole irradiation area by performing irradiation separately for a plural times. In a case where necessary irradiation dose is 5GyE, and in the irradiation control calculation part 70, it is evaluated such that 3GyE of irradiation dose can be radiated to whole irradiation area by an amount of a particle beam which is extracted from an accelerator by a single acceleration, first, whole irradiation spots are irradiated with a particle beam which is accelerated by the first acceleration in a accelerator within one gate so as to give 3GyE of irradiation dose to an irradiation target. Next, whole irradiation spots are irradiated again with a particle beam which is accelerated by the second acceleration in the accelerator within one gate after the second acceleration<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> so as to give 2GyE of irradiation dose to the irradiation target. As above-mentioned, by using time length of two gates, 5GyE of irradiation dose in total can be given by irradiating whole irradiation spots within each gate. As above-mentioned, it is not always necessary to irradiate whole dose within one gate, but irradiation may be performed separately within a plurality of gates. However, in one gate, all irradiation spots should be irradiated, and in the following gate, all irradiation spots should be also irradiated. Since all irradiation spots are irradiated within one gate, irradiation with high accuracy can be realized at each gate. Therefore, irradiation dose with high accuracy in total can be obtained.</p><heading id="h0013">EMBODIMENT 3</heading><p id="p0033" num="0033"><figref idrefs="f0009">FIG.9</figref> is a block diagram showing an outline of configuration of a particle beam irradiation system according to EMBODIMENT 3 of the present invention.

In EMBODIMENT 1 and EMBODIMENT 2, a SOBP is formed to have a predetermined width in a depth direction by a ridge filter 43. However, there are various shapes of an affected site. Therefore, scope of applications is limited when a SOBP having a constant width in a depth direction is formed. In EMBODIMENT 3, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG.9</figref>, a cone ridge filter 431 and a bolus 46 are used as an energy width expanding device. The cone ridge filter 431 is formed by arranging a large number of cones having an extremely thin shape in an XY phase which is perpendicular to a travelling direction of a beam so as for the travelling direction of a beam (z direction) to be an axis. As conceptually<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> shown in <figref idrefs="f0009">FIG.9</figref>, for example, by changing a height of a cone, impact which is received by a particle beam which passes through the cone ridge filter is different depending on a part of an XY plane, and a particle beam having a different energy width depending on a position can be irradiated to an irradiation target.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034"><figref idrefs="f0010">FIG.10</figref> shows an example of a SOBP which is formed by a particle beam which has passed the cone ridge filter 431. In <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG.10</figref>, a solid line indicated by A shows a SOBP which is formed by a particle beam which has passed the cone ridge filter 431, in a case where a particle beam passes a part at which a cone having a high height is arranged (for example, a central part). Therefore, the SOBP has a wide width. A broken line indicated by B shows a SOBP which is formed by a particle beam which has passed the cone ridge filter 431 in a case where a particle beam passes a part at which a cone whose height is lower than a part which is indicated by a curve line of A is arranged (for example, the surrounding area of a central part). Therefore, the SOBP has a width which is narrower than A. A curve line of alternate long and short dash line indicated by C shows a SOBP which is formed by a particle beam which has passed the cone ridge filter 431 in a case where a particle beam passes a part at which a cone whose height is lower than that is arranged at a part which is indicated by a curve line of B (for example, the surrounding area). Therefore, the SOBP has a width which is much narrower than B. As above mentioned, a width of a SOBP is different depending on a height of a cone which is arranged. The larger a width of a SOBP, the larger necessary irradiation dose (number of irradiation particle)<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> for obtaining an equal amount of dose at the center of a SOBP. Therefore, irradiation dose should be controlled corresponding to arrangement of a cone ridge filter. As above mentioned, scanning irradiation is most appropriate irradiation method as a method to adjust an irradiation dose corresponding to arrangement of a cone ridge filter.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">A particle beam which has passed the cone ridge filter 431 passes the bolus 46. A bolus is a limiter formed of a resin or the like. An energy of a particle beam which passes a bolus is limited so as to limit a range of a particle beam corresponding to a depth shape of an irradiation target. When a particle beam whose energy width is expanded by the cone ridge filter 431 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG.10</figref> passes the bolus 46, it becomes a particle beam which forms a SOBP having a depth direction shown in <figref idrefs="f0011">FIG.11</figref>. That is, for example, a particle beam which has passed a central part indicated by a curve line A in <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG.10</figref> also passes through a central part of the bolus 46, therefore, an energy is not limited so much. Consequently, a SOBP having a wide width and reaching a depth up to 300mm, as shown by a curve line indicated by a solid line A1 in <figref idrefs="f0011">FIG.11</figref>, is formed. Further, energy of a particle beam which has passed through a surrounding area of a central part shown by a curve line B in <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG.10</figref> is limited by the bolus 46. Therefore, as shown by a curve line indicated by a broken line B1 in <figref idrefs="f0011">FIG.11</figref>, a SOBP having a slightly narrow width and reaching a depth limited up to 270mm is formed. Further, energy of a particle beam which has passed through a surrounding area shown by a curve line C in <figref idrefs="f0010">FIG.10</figref> is limited significantly by the bolus 46.
