present invention relates to mobile communication, and in particular, to a method and an apparatus of list management in a communication system.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">With the development of mobile communication technologies, more and more mobile communication systems come forth, such as Global System For Mobile Communication (GSM) which is also known as the 2<sup>nd</sup> Generation (2G) mobile communication system, and Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA), Code Division Multiple Access 2000 (CDMA2000), and Time Division-Synchronous CDMA (TD-SCDMA), which are also known as the 3<sup>rd</sup> Generation (3G) mobile communication system, and the systems currently under development, e.g. Long Term Evolution (LTE) and World Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX). The user's requirements are more diversified with the development of the mobile communication technologies, and more attention is paid to the system devices such as base stations for the home domestic coverage, or the enterprise-class internal coverage, as well as other restricted networks. In this context, example devices and networks are as follows: home Node B, home cell, access point, private network, private cell, and the restricted networks of some specific frequency layers.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The concepts of Closed Subscriber Group (CSG) and Prioritized Subscriber Group (PSG) have been introduced for private networks. A CSG network may include one or more cells. If a subscriber subscribes to a CSG or is added by the CSG administrator into the CSG, the subscriber is normally allowed to camp on a CSG cell and apply for services. The subscriber is normally unable to camp on the CSG cell or initiate a service otherwise. That is, the CSG network or cell only provides services for the CSG members, and Non-CSG members are not allowed to use any service of the CSG network or cell except emergency calls. In the PSG network, all terminals are allowed to camp on it, but the terminals are sorted according to priority. Therefore, some terminals in the connected state may be provided with better Quality of Service (QoS) or more types of service than other terminals. The terminal in the idle state may be judged to be preferential to camp on the cell of the PSG network if it has the higher priority. That is, only the PSG member can use the preferential services provided by the PSG network or cell, and non-PSG members are allowed to roam to the PSG network or cell, but cannot use the preferential services.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">A method and apparatus of list management is provided according to a first aspect of the present invention which helps reduce or eliminate the problem of heavy load and cost of the core network<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> nodes as described above.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">An example list management method is provided according to a second aspect of the present invention.

Evidently, the embodiments given herein are only part of all possible embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In an example system, such as an LTE system, a terminal may store a list of CSG networks or cells, which are accessible for the terminal. When the terminal approaches a CSG network or cell, it starts measuring the CSG network or cell, and judges whether the CSG network or cell is accessible. Alternatively, a terminal may store a list of PSG networks or cells in which the terminal can be treated as preferential user.

In the LTE system the management of the list can only be implemented through new messages, which are different from any existing signaling, between the terminal and the core network. Therefore, in order to support the functions of the private network according to the default, it is necessary to modify the nodes of the core network side massively, which will increase the load of the core network nodes and make the upgrade of the network or the device costly.

A kind of message during an access control process, such as NAS message, may be sent between the terminal and the network side. Therefore, a Location Area (LA) or a Tracking Area (TA) of the CSG network or cell may be configured to be different from that of the macro cells. When the terminal searches the CSG cell or camps on the CSG cell, Location Area Update (LAU) or Tracking Area Update (TAU) is triggered.

On the one hand, the PSG network or cell supports manual selection. For example, a string to identify a CSG cell may be delivered through a broadcast channel of the PSG cell, and the terminal is able to identify the string and display it through an MMI; on the other hand, a kind of message during an access control process signaling, such as NAS message, may be sent between the terminal and the network side. Therefore, different LAs or TAs may be configured for the PSG network or cell. When the terminal searches the PSG cell or camps on the PSG cell, LAU or TAU (including periodical update) is triggered. The network side sends a NAS or RRC message carrying a preferential indication or non-preferential indication. In this way, the terminal knows whether it is a preferential user of the PSG network or cell, and updates the PSG list accordingly. The specific management method is as follows.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">Case 21: When the terminal is accepted as a preferential user to access the PSG network or<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> cell which is not stored in the PSG list, the PSG network or cell is added to the PSG list.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">For example, cell C is a PSG cell and is not stored in the PSG list of the terminal. If the terminal receives a preferential access indication indicating the terminal can preferentially access cell C, the terminal confirms that it can access cell C as a preferential user.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">If the user receives the indication after the user's manual trigger, e.g. the user uses the MMI of the terminal to manually input a trigger, and the terminal receives the indication afterwards, the terminal preferably stores the entry of cell C in the PSG list automatically when the terminal confirms that it can access cell C as a preferential user. If the user receives the indication without any user's manual trigger, e.g. the user does not use the MMI of the terminal to manually input a trigger, the terminal displays the information about permission of accessing cell C as a preferential user to the user through the MMI. The user has a choice to store the entry of cell C in the PSG list or not, and perform the corresponding manual operations.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">Case 22: When the terminal is forbidden to access the PSG network or cell, stored in the PSG list, as a preferential user, the PSG network or cell is preferably deleted from the PSG list.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">For example, cell D is a PSG cell stored in the PSG list of the terminal. When the terminal in cell D confirms that the terminal is not allowed to access or camp on the PSG cell as a preferential user, the terminal deletes the PSG from the PSG list. The indication may be carried by a LAU response or a TAU response. If the terminal initiates a process of LAU or TAU through a NAS message sent to the network side, and receives a response carrying a non-preferential access indication and/or a response carrying no preferential access indication, the terminal confirms that it is forbidden to access cell D as a preferential user. If the terminal initiates a RRC connection setup progress through an RRC connection setup message or a reconstruction process through a reconstruction message sent to the network side, and receives a response carrying a non-preferential access indication and/or a response carrying no preferential access indication, the terminal confirms that the terminal is forbidden to access cell D as a preferential user. If the terminal initiates an RRC connection release process through an RRC connection release message sent to the network side, and receives from the network side, an RRC connection release message carrying a release cause value indicating the preferential access is not allowed, the terminal confirms that the terminal is forbidden to access cell D as a preferential user.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">If the foregoing process of update, connection or release is triggered by the user manually, i.e. the user uses the MMI of the terminal to manually input a command to trigger the foregoing process, the terminal deletes cell D automatically from the PSG list after confirming that the terminal is forbidden to access cell D as a preferential user.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">If the foregoing process is triggered by the user in a non-manual mode, i.e. the user does not<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> manually input a command to trigger the foregoing process, the terminal determines whether the terminal is forbidden to access cell D. If such is the case, the terminal displays the information about the rejection through the MMI to inform the user as a preferential user. The user has a choice to delete cell D from the PSG list, and perform the corresponding manual operations.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">Case 23: The terminal updates the PSG list when it finds information inconsistent with the PSG list.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">In a process of candidate search or manual search, if the terminal finds that the information about the PSG network or cell is inconsistent with the information stored in the PSG list, the terminal may verify the accuracy of the information, and choose to update the PSG list or not.

Therefore, the cost of network upgrade may be reduced.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>, an example automatic search management method of CSG lists is disclosed in the third embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">In this embodiment, before the cell reselection or cell access, the terminal may perform automatic search according to the information in the CSG list to confirm whether the access is allowed. Alternatively, the terminal uses other search modes, such as search according to neighboring cell list or manual search. The details of the method are as follows.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">Case 31: The user side determines whether the terminal applies automatic search.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">The user may determine whether the terminal applies automatic search according to the actual<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> conditions. If the decision is not to automatically search the CSG networks or cells in one or more CSG lists, the user may manually input the corresponding indications indicating the automatic search is not available. When the terminal confirms it is allowed to access a CSG network or cell, the user can still choose not to perform automatic search for the network or cell.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">Case 32: The network side determines whether the terminal applies automatic search.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">The network side may determine whether the terminal applies the automatic search function according to the actual conditions, and deliver an indication indicating the terminal to apply automatic search or not on searching a CSG network or cell.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">Specifically, the network side may deliver the indication through broadcast information, a NAS message, or an RRC dedicated signaling. The indication may be denoted by the content of one bit. For example, 0 indicates the automatic search is not available, 1 indicates the automatic search is available. Alternatively, the available automatic search may be indicated by sending an indication, and if there is no indication, the automatic search is not available. For example, sending of 1-bit information indicates the automatic search is available, and lack of sending the 1-bit information or the information sent being "null" indicates the automatic search is not available.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">When the terminal adds or updates information in the CSG list, the terminal sets the automatic search function according to the indication delivered by the network side and its own indication. For example, if the network side allows the terminal to access a CSG cell and delivers an indication indicating the automatic search is available, but the user refuses to apply automatic search to the CSG cell, the user may store the entry of the CSG cell into the CSG list, and indicate the corresponding automatic search is disabled. In another example, the network side forbids the terminal to use a CSG cell, but when the terminal informs the user to delete the CSG cell from the CSG list, the user refuses the deletion through manual input. Therefore, the CSG list of the terminal still reserves the entry of the CSG cell, and indicates the corresponding automatic search is disabled.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">It is understandable for those skilled in the art that the automatic search management method of the PSG list is similar to the automatic search management method of the CSG list described above.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">In the third embodiment of the present invention, the network side gives an indication of automatic search so that the user has more accurate information from the network side.
