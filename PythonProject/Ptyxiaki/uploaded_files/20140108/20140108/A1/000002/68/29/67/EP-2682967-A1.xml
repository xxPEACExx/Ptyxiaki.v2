This capacitor element is formed by winding an anode foil containing a valve action metal such as tantalum and aluminum together with a cathode foil. The electrolytic solution for driving the capacitor or the solid electrolyte is retained in the capacitor element. The outer casing houses the capacitor element and the driving electrolytic solution or the solid electrolyte. The anode foil of such an electrolytic capacitor is connected to an anode electrode via a lead terminal. On the other hand, the cathode foil is connected to a cathode electrode via a lead terminal. These lead terminals are connected to the anode or cathode foil by means of e.g. stitching and ultrasonic welding.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The lead terminal has three parts, which are, an aluminum wire which connects to the anode or cathode foil, a connection part formed at the end of the aluminum wire, and a lead wire which is joined to the connection part. A lead plating layer is formed on the lead wire. The end of this lead wire is joined to the connection part formed at the end of the aluminum wire by means of arc welding. However, lead used in the lead wire is a substance that is not only harmful to the human body but has a bad influence on the natural environment. Accordingly, in recent years, development of<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> electronic parts that do not use any lead has been promoted in regards to environmental protection.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">A capacitor that does not use any lead, as shown in Patent Document 1, uses a copper-coated steel wire applied with tin plating consisting of 100% tin as the lead wire. This tin plating is joined by inserting and arc welding the copper-coated steel wire into a recessed portion provided at one end of the round bar portion of the lead wire. In this aluminum electrolytic capacitor, a fusion layer of copper, tin, and aluminum produced by heating copper, tin plating, and aluminum is formed at the connecting part between the lead wire and the round bar portion.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">However, in Patent Document 1, whiskers may develop from the fusion layer produced at the connection part between the round bar portion of the lead terminal and the tin-plated lead wire. These whiskers are fibrous crystals of tin, and may reach a length of 1 mm or more against a diameter of 1 µm. Due to the development of these whiskers, in the worst case scenario there is a risk of short circuiting between a pair of lead terminals. There is also a risk of the whisker falling onto a substrate and causing a short circuit between other electronic parts and between substrate patterns.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Various technologies have been conventionally proposed for suppressing the development or growth of these whiskers. In Patent Document 2, the lead wire of the capacitor is washed with an alkaline washing fluid. After removing this washing fluid, it is applied to heat treatment to prevent the development of whiskers. In Patent Document 3, the welding point of connecting the CP wire to the aluminum round bar by welding is provided with a waterproof film, and whisker growth is suppressed by this waterproof film. In Patent Document 4, vacuum state is made and filled with an inert gas, and high temperature heat treatment is applied. By doing so, internal<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> applied force of the welding point of the capacitor lead wire is relaxed, and whisker development at the welding portion is prevented.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>BACKGROUND ART</u></heading><p id="p0007" num="0007"><ul><li>Patent Document 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP2000124073A"><text>JP2000-124073 A</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 2: <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP2007067146A"><text>JP2007-67146 A</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 3: <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP2007335714A"><text>JP2007-335714 A</text></patcit></li><li>Patent Document 4: <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="JP2008130782A"><text>JP2008-130782 A</text></patcit></li></ul></p><heading id="h0004"><u>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><heading id="h0005"><u>PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">However, in Patent Documents 2 and 4, the development of whiskers could not be completely prevented, and therefore effects were insufficient.

Symbol 1 in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref> shows a capacitor element of an anode foil and a cathode foil that are wound together with a separator therebetween. Capacitor element 1 is configured to be housed in an outer casing 2 together with a driving electrolyte or a solid electrolyte. The anode and cathode foils of the capacitor element 1 are provided with electrodes (not shown) . The electrodes of these anode and cathode foils are connected with lead terminals 3 for connecting with the outside.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The lead terminal 3 is configured from three parts, that are an aluminum wire 4, a connection part 5, and a lead wire 6. This aluminum wire 4 is connected to the anode or cathode foil. The connection part 5 is integrally formed at the end of this aluminum wire 4. The lead wire 6 plated with a metal<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> composed of mainly tin formed thereon is connected to the connection part 5. Various methods can be utilized as the method to connect the connection part 5 and the lead wire 6. For example, they may be connected by inserting and arc welding the lead wire 6 into a recessed portion formed in the connection part 5.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The surface of the connection part 5 is coated by a resin layer 7. This resin layer 7 is provided by applying and curing a liquid curing resin containing 1 wt% or more of a flaky filler. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, the lead terminal 3 having the coated connection part 5 is inserted into a through-hole 8 of seal 9. A liquid curing resin is filled and cured in the gap between the lead wire 6 and the through-hole 8 to form the resin layer 7.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">This resin layer 7 is the liquid curing resin filled in the gap between the through-hole 8 and the lead wire 6. Accordingly, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 2</figref>, the liquid curing resin may be filled not only in the through-hole 8 into which the lead wire 6 is inserted, but also overflowing on all surface of a seal 9 on the lead-out side of the lead wire 6. Further, the seal 9 may be provided with a belt-like recessed portion so that the through-holes 8 are linked to each other, and the liquid curing resin poured therein. In other words, a portion or all of the surface of the seal 9 comprising through-holes 8 may be filled.</p><heading id="h0011">[1-2. Types of Liquid Curing Resin]</heading><p id="p0020" num="0020">The liquid curing resin of the present invention is not particularly limited, examples of which include a silicone resin, a modified silicone resin, a hybrid silicone resin, an epoxy resin, a phenol resin, a melamine resin, a urea resin, a fluorine resin, a urethane resin, a urethane acrylic resin, an acrylic resin, a polyester resin, and a polyimide resin. Particularly among silicone resins, an addition curing<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> silicone, a condensation curing silicone, an addition curing modified silicone, or a condensation curing modified silicone, as well as a hybrid silicone resin are preferred in regards to heat resistance and weather resistance.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The liquid curing resin may contain any other components according to the necessity in a range that does not compromise the object of the present invention. The any component includes e.g. the following (1) to (6).
<ol><li>(1) An inorganic filler such as dry silica, wet silica, calcinated silica, crystalline silica, titanium oxide, alumina, calcium carbonate, and carbon black.</li><li>(2) A filler that is prepared by treating a filler of (1) by an organosilicone compound such as an organohalosilane, an organoalkoxysilane, and an organosilazane.</li><li>(3) An organic resin micropowder such as a silicone resin, an epoxy resin, and a fluorine resin.</li><li>(4) A conductive metal powder such as silver and copper.</li><li>(5) A diluent such as toluene and xylene.</li><li>(6) Others such as dyes and pigments.</li></ol></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Moreover, the liquid curing resin may be treated so that the range of area that the liquid curing resin was applied or filled can be distinguished. It can, for example, be treated to contain a dyestuff in order to improve visibility. Alternatively, an element different from the element that configures the lead terminal can be mixed therein. The liquid curing resin can be applied or filled by confirmation of this element. By doing so, verification of whether the liquid curing resin is appropriately applied or filled will be facilitated in the manufacturing step.</p><heading id="h0012">[1-3. Types of Flaky Filler]</heading><p id="p0023" num="0023">The flaky filler of the present invention is a material<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> for suppressing whisker growth. Examples of a flaky filler include but are not particularly limited to a natural mica such as bronze mica, white mica, and sericite, a synthetic mica such as fluorine bronze mica, potassium tetrasilicone mica, sodium tetrasilicone mica, sodium taeniolite, and lithium taeniolite, a natural smectite such as montmorillonite, a synthetic smectite such as sodium hectorite, lithium hectorite, and saponite, bentonite, talc, expanded graphite, aluminum silicate, magnesium silicate, boehmite, clay, diatomite, carbon black, silica, barium sulfate, calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, metal oxide, graphite, and aluminum hydroxide. In particular, natural micas such as inexpensive white mica and synthetic micas are preferred because of their ease in aspect ratio adjustment. These flaky fillers have a large planar portion relative to the weight added. Accordingly, just a small amount of the flaky filler added to the resin will increase the probability of planar portion collision during whisker growth, and whisker growth can be suppressed. In contrast, with a filler that does not have a large planar portion or with a spherical or a needle-like filler, whisker growth cannot be effectively suppressed because the filler is thrown aside even when whiskers collide, or the whiskers avoid the filler when growing.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">As a shape of the flaky filler, it is desirable to have the average aspect ratio of 70 or higher. When the average aspect ratio is 70 or higher, whisker growth suppression effect is high and appearance of a whisker from the resin surface can be effectively prevented. Moreover, the average particle size is not particularly limited but is preferably 1000 µm or less, more preferably 200 µm or less. When the average particle size of the flaky filler is greater than 1000 µm, applicability and mouldability of the liquid curing resin is significantly reduced.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Further, the flaky filler is added in the range of 1<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> wt% or more and 50 wt% and less of the liquid curing resin. Effect cannot be sufficiently exerted when the amount of the filler added is less than 1 wt%, and application of the resin becomes difficult or mouldability becomes significantly reduced if it is greater than 50 wt%.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">These flaky fillers may be applied to the hydrophobic treatment with a surface treatment agent such as a silane coupling agent, a quaternary ammonium salt, and a polyether. By applying hydrophobic treatment, the surface energy of the filler is reduced and allows easier mixing with the liquid curing resin, thereby having the effect to decrease the viscosity of the resin composition.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Further, any form can be used for the flaky filler such as a powder, a dispersed solution type, and granules, as long as it is possible to be dispersed into the liquid curing resin.
