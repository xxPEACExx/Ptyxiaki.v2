The interior of an elevator cab may be finished in a variety of styles. Many elevator cabs include a car operating panel that allows the passenger to select the floor to which she desires to be carried. The car operating panel is typically designed to have a finished look consistent with the interior of the cab. </p><p id="p0004" num="0004"> [0002] When assembling elevator cabs, a variety of challenges may be presented. For example, it is sometimes necessary to design custom pieces to accommodate variations in cab size. Designing custom pieces for various cab sizes has the drawback of increasing costs and requiring a larger inventory of available components for installation personnel. SUMMARY </p><p id="p0005" num="0005"> [0003] An exemplary elevator cab wall panel includes a plurality of panel members that are selectively moveable relative to each other to adjust the size of the panel.

The wall panel provides a finished wall surface in the space. </p><p id="p0006" num="0006"> [0004] An exemplary elevator cab includes a floor, a ceiling and a plurality of walls between the floor and ceiling. A car operating panel is supported on one of the walls with a space adjacent the car operating panel between the car operating panel and at least one of the floor or the ceiling. A wall panel includes a plurality of panel members that are selectively moveable relative to each other to adjust the size of the wall panel for selectively covering the space adjacent the car operating panel. The wall panel provides a finished wall surface in the space. </p><p id="p0007" num="0007"> [0005] An exemplary method of covering a space between a car operating panel and a nearby surface in an elevator cab includes positioning a plurality of panel members between the car operating panel and the nearby surface. The panel members are then allowed to move relative to each other until the panel members cover the space and provide a finished surface for covering the space.

 [0006] The various features and advantages of a disclosed embodiment of this invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description. The drawings that accompany the detailed description can be briefly described as follows. </p><p id="p0008" num="0008">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </p><p id="p0009" num="0009"> [0007] Figure 1 schematically illustrates selected portions of an elevator cab designed according to an embodiment of this invention. </p><p id="p0010" num="0010"> [0008] Figure 2 schematically illustrates an example wall panel designed according to an embodiment of this invention including panel members in a first position relative to each other. </p><p id="p0011" num="0011"> [0009] Figure 3 schematically illustrates the example wall panel of Figure 2 with the panel members in a second position relative to each other. </p><p id="p0012" num="0012"> [00010] Figure 4 schematically illustrates selected features of the example of Figure 2. </p><p id="p0013" num="0013"> [00011] Figure 5 schematically illustrates the selected features of Figure 4 in another position. </p><p id="p0014" num="0014">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </p><p id="p0015" num="0015"> [00012] Figure 1 schematically illustrates selected portions of an elevator cab</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">20. In this example, the cab 20 includes elevator car doors 22 that are moveable in a known manner for allowing access to the interior of the elevator cab. One wall portion 24 is on one side of the doors 22 while another wall portion 26 is on an opposite side of the doors 22. In this example, a car operating panel 28 is provided on the wall portion 26. The car operating panel 28 allows passengers to select a desired destination, for example. </p><p id="p0017" num="0017"> [00013] A wall panel 30 is positioned between the car operating panel 28 and a floor 32 of the elevator cab 20. When the car operating panel 28 is installed, there is a space S between the car operating panel 28 and a nearby surface in the elevator cab such as the surface of the floor 32. The wall panel 30 covers the space S and provides a finished surface in the space S. When the example wall panel 30 is installed, there is no need to do anything more to finish off the space S. </p><p id="p0018" num="0018"> [00014] The wall panel 30 has a selectively adjustable outside dimension for accommodating spaces S of different sizes in different elevator cabs. The space S 
<!-- EPO <DP n="4"/>-->
 may vary between a bottom, for example, of the car operating panel 28 and the floor 32 of the elevator cab among different elevator cabs. The example wall panel 30 facilitates economical assembly and installation of the elevator cab 20 by providing the ability to readily fill the space S and cover it with a finished surface provided by the wall panel 30. </p><p id="p0019" num="0019"> [00015] It should be noted that the space S shown in Figure 1 is illustrated for discussion purposes. The relative proportions or dimensions of the different features of the illustrated elevator cab 20 may be different than what is shown in the illustration. For example, the dimensions of the car operating panel 28 relative to the wall portion 26 may be different. The size of the space S may be, for example, on the order of 10 to 15 millimeters high and 500 millimeters wide when viewed from inside the elevator cab. </p><p id="p0020" num="0020"> [00016] As can be appreciated from Figure 2, the wall panel 30 comprises a plurality of panel members 34. The illustration shows four panel members 34A, 34B, 34C and 34D. A different number of panel members may be included in other examples of the wall panel 30. In Figure 2 the panel members 34 are compressed relatively tightly together to establish a first outside dimension HI. In this first, contracted position, a plurality of primary panel portions 36A, 36B, 36C and 36D establish a finish surface for covering a space S that has a size corresponding to the first outside dimension HI. In the contracted position shown in Figure 2, the primary panel portions 36 are received adjacent each other and collectively provide the finish surface used to cover the space S. </p><p id="p0021" num="0021"> [00017] Figure 3 shows the panel members 34 in a second, expanded position. As shown in Figure 3, the panel members 34 include the primary panel portions 36 and secondary panel portions 38 A, 38B, 38C and 38D, respectively. In the expanded position of Figure 3, the primary panel portions 36 and the secondary panel portions 38 collectively establish a second, larger outside dimension H2. </p><p id="p0022" num="0022"> [00018] By comparing Figures 2 and 3 it is possible to see how the wall panel 30 is adjustable to accommodate different dimensions of the space S between a car operating panel 28 and a nearby surface in an elevator cab to cover that space and provide a finished surface across it. In the example of Figure 3, the primary panel portions 36 and the secondary panel portions 38 provide the finished surface when the wall panel 30 is correctly positioned within the elevator cab. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="5"/>-->
 [00019] In the example of Figures 2 and 3, the wall panel members 34 are automatically moveable from the contracted position shown in Figure 2 to the expanded position shown in Figure 3. Figure 4 schematically illustrates one example arrangement for providing such automatic movement. A plurality of biasing members 40 selectively urge the panel members 34 away from each other into the expanded position of Figure 3. In this example, the biasing members 40 comprise springs having a first end 42 secured to one of the panel members and a second end 44 received against a reaction surface 46 on an adjacent one of the panel members. In one example, the panel members 34 and the springs 40 are integrally formed together as a single piece. One example embodiment includes plastic panel members 34 and plastic springs 40. </p><p id="p0023" num="0023"> [00020] The illustrated example includes limiting members for limiting an amount of expansion or adjustment of the panel members 34 relative to each other. Each of the limiting members in this example includes a stem 50 that is connected to one of the panel members 34. The stem 50 is at least partially received through a slot 52 in an adjacent one of the panel members 34. As the panel members 34 are moveable relative to each other, the stem 50 moves through the slot 52. </p><p id="p0024" num="0024"> [00021] Each of the example limiting members includes a stop surface 54 that is received against a reaction surface 56 on the adjacent one of the panel members 34 when the biasing members 40 are urging the panel members 34 away from each other a furthest possible distance established by the length of the stems 50. </p><p id="p0025" num="0025"> [00022] As can be appreciated from the illustrations, the example wall panel 30 accommodates a variety of sizes of space S between a car operating panel 28 and a nearby surface in an elevator cab. Various expanded positions are possible between the contracted position in which the primary panel portions 36 are received adjacent to and tightly against each other in one example and a furthest expanded position in which the primary panel portions 36 are spaced apart from each other a maximum desired distance in the expanded position, the secondary panel portions 38 cover the distance between adjacent primary panel portions 36. </p><p id="p0026" num="0026"> [00023] Installing the example wall panel 30 is a relatively easy task according to an example embodiment. The panel members 34 are compressed relative to each other against the bias of the biasing members 40 into the retracted position shown in Figure 2, for example. The wall panel 30 is then positioned within the elevator cab between the car operating panel 28 and the nearby surface such as the floor 32. The 
<!-- EPO <DP n="6"/>-->
 panel members 34 are then allowed to automatically move relative to each other by action of the biasing members 40 until the panel members 34 have moved into an expanded position having an outside dimension that is approximately equal to the corresponding dimension of the space S. In other words, the wall panel members 34 automatically move into a position relative to each other for covering over the space S and providing a finished surface within the elevator cab between the car operating panel 28 and the nearby surface such as the floor 32. </p><p id="p0027" num="0027"> [00024] The preceding description is exemplary rather than limiting in nature. Variations and modifications to the disclosed examples may become apparent to those skilled in the art that do not necessarily depart from the essence of this invention. The scope of legal protection given to this invention can only be determined by studying the following claims.
