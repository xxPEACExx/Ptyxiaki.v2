id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a light irradiation device capable of irradiating, for example, line-shaped light using a plurality of LEDs, and in particular to a light irradiation device appropriately used for inspection such as checking presence or absence of a crack in a predetermined irradiation region of a work (product), reading a mark and the like.</p><heading id="h0002">Background Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Conventionally, as disclosed in Patent Literature 1, there has been considered as a line light irradiation device that includes a long-size shaped LED substrate having a plurality of LEDs mounted thereon, a casing for accommodating this LED substrate, and a round bar shaped rod lens fixed to the casing for condensing light rays from the plurality of LEDs to line shaped one. Specifically, a structure for fixing the rod lens positioned above the LEDs is configured of projections corresponding to an outer diameter of the rod lens and buffer members provided between the projections and the rod lens to thereby prevent looseness of the rod lens.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">However, the line light irradiation device described in this Patent Literature 1 is to be assembled by inserting the rod lens into the casing along a longitudinal direction while the casing is in a state of fixing the buffer members to the projections. If so, there arises a problem that it is hard to insert the rod lens into the casing due to a slip resistance between the buffer members and the rod lens. This problem becomes more remarkable as a longitudinal size of the casing becomes larger or longitudinal size of the rod lens becomes longer.</p><heading id="h0003">Citation List</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004"><ul><li>Patent Literature 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP010112939A"><text>JP-A2010-112939</text></patcit></li></ul><!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><heading id="h0005">Summary of Invention</heading><heading id="h0006">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">Therefore, the present invention has been made in order to solve the above problem at a stroke and a main expected object thereof is to fix a lens to a casing and not only prevent looseness thereof but also facilitate an assembling work. Solution to Problem</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">That is, a line light irradiation device according to the present invention is characterized by including: an integrally molded casing having a bottom wall part extending in a longitudinal direction and a pair of side wall parts extending upward from both sides in the longitudinal direction of this bottom wall part; an LED substrate provided on the bottom wall part of the casing; a rod-shaped lens provided above the LED substrate along the longitudinal direction inside the casing; and a fixing mechanism for fixing the lens to the pair of side wall parts, wherein the fixing mechanism includes: an upward surface provided along the longitudinal direction in an inner surface of each of the side wall parts; a downward surface provided along the longitudinal direction in each side peripheral surface of the lens; a concave groove provided along the longitudinal direction above the upward surface in the inner surface of each of the side wall parts; and an elastic body detachably provided in the concave groove and fitting into the concave groove to be in contact with the side peripheral surface of the lens in a state that the downward surface is in contact with the upward surface to thereby press the downward surface to the upward surface. Here, the upward surface may just be a surface having an upward component and is a concept including an inclined surface or a curved surface besides a substantially horizontal surface. Further, the downward surface may just be a surface having a downward component and is a concept including an inclined surface or a curved surface besides a substantially horizontal surface. At this time, it is desirable that the upward surface and the downward surface may be in surface-contact.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">With a configuration like this, the fixing mechanism includes the upward surface provided in the inner surface of each of the side wall parts and the downward surface provided in the side peripheral surface of the lens, and the lens<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> can be fixed to the casing while positioning the lens to the casing in the vertical direction by contacting between these upward surface and downward surface. Further, since the fixing mechanism includes the concave groove and the elastic body which is fit to this concave groove to press the side peripheral surface of the lens, the lens can be fixed to the casing while preventing the looseness of the lens with respect to the casing. Moreover, after contacting the downward surface with the upward surface, the lens can be pressed and fixed to the casing only by fitting the elastic body to the concave groove, whereby the assembling work can be facilitated. At this time, since the elastic body is not fit to the concave groove at the time of attaching the lens to the casing, a work of attaching the lens to the casing can be facilitated. In addition, since the casing is integrally molded, not only the number of assembling man-hours can be reduced but also heat dissipation performance of the casing can be improved.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In order to prevent the elastic body from being detached from the concave groove in a state the elastic body is fit to the concave groove, it is desirable that a shortest distance between the upper end portion of the concave groove and the side peripheral surface of the lens is smaller than a width size in the natural state of the elastic body.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In order to reduce the number of manufacturing man-hours of the casing and to be able to appropriately use the casing in the line light irradiation device, it is desirable that the casing is integrally formed by extrusion molding or pultrusion molding.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">It is desirable that the upward surface is formed of the upper surface of the projected rim part provided along the longitudinal direction in the inner surface of each of the side wall parts and the downward surface is formed of the lower surface of each of two notch portions which are provided along the side peripheral surface of the lens and symmetrically formed with respect to the optical axis. With this configuration, even in the case of using integrally molded one, the lens can be positioned. Further, the notch portions are only provided and it may be sufficient to only perform, for example, a process of such as cutting of the existing lens, the processing is easy and a manufacturing cost can also be<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> made inexpensive.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In order to perform the horizontal positioning of the lens to the LED mounted on the LED substrate at the same time of fixing the lens to the casing, it is desirable that the projected rim part has the inward surface which is substantially perpendicular to the upward surface, the notch portion has an outward surface which is substantially perpendicular to the downward surface, the inward surface of the projected rim part is in contact with the outward surface of the notch portion, and the upward surface of the projected rim part is in contact with the downward surface of the notch portion. With this configuration, the horizontal positioning of the lens can be performed by the inward surface of the projected rim part and the downward surface of the notch, and the other positioning structure for positioning the casing and lens can be made unnecessary to thereby simplify the configuration of the line light irradiation device.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">It is desirable that the space between the upper side portions above the projected rim parts of the pair of side wall parts is configured to be larger than the outer diameter of the lens. With this configuration, the lens can be accommodated from an upper opening of the case and the assembling work can be facilitated.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Further, as a manufacturing method peculiar to the above-mentioned line light irradiation device, it is characterized by including: a lens accommodation process of accommodating the lens in the casing; and an elastic body fitting process of fitting the elastic body into the concave groove after the lens accommodation process.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Here, in order to facilitate the work of fitting the elastic body into the concave groove and improve the workability, it is desirable that the elastic body fitting process fits the elastic body into the concave groove using a jig after the elastic body fitting process arranges the elastic body in the gap between the upper end portion of the concave portion and the side surface of the lens.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">It is desirable that the jig includes the jig main body having the tip surface<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> which is in contact with the elastic body and the guide part which is provided in the jig main body and to be in contact with the upper surface of the casing, and, by bringing the guide part into contact with the upper surface of the casing, the tip surface of the jig main body is in contact with the elastic body to thereby fit the elastic body to the concave groove. With this configuration, since the tip surface of the jig main body renders the elastic body to be fit into the concave groove in a state that the guide part is in contact with the upper surface of the casing, the elastic body can be surely fit into the concave groove and there arises no problem such that the elastic body is destroyed due to a power at the time of fitting added too excessively.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">More specifically, it is desirable that, the jig main body is the main body roller which is rotatable about the rotation axis, the guide part is the guide roller coaxially provided with the rotation axis of the roller, and by rolling the guide roller while contacting with the upper surface of the casing in a state that one side surface of the main body roller is along the inner side surface of the casing, the side peripheral end surface of the main body roller is in contact with the elastic body to thereby fit the elastic body into the concave groove. With a configuration like this, by only rolling the jig and the guide roller thereof on the upper surface of the casing, the elastic body can be fit into the concave groove.

In addition, the light transmission plate 6 such as a diffusion plate and a protection cover is provided in a front (upper portion) in a light outgoing side of the rod lens 4, and since this light transmission plate 6 is thermally expanded, it is attached by a slide groove 7 with a slight play formed in an inner surface of each of the left and right side walls 22 and 23.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, the fixing mechanism 5 is intended to fix the rod lens 4 to the pair of left and right side wall parts 22 and 23 of the casing 2, and it<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> includes a projected rim part 51 provided along the longitudinal direction in an inner surface of each of the left and right side wall parts 22 and 23, two notch portions 52 provided along the longitudinal direction in side peripheral surfaces of the rod lens 4, a concave groove 53 provided along the longitudinal direction above the projected rim part 51 in the inner surface of each of the left and right side wall parts 22 and 23, and an elastic body 54 detachably provided in each of the concave grooves 53.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Especially, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, each projected rim part 51 is provided to be projected inward from the inner surface and extending over from one end to the other end in the longitudinal direction of each of the left and right side wall parts 22 and 23, and it includes an upward surface 51a which is a generally horizontal plane and an inward surface 51b which is a plane generally perpendicular to the upward surface 51a.

In this state of accommodating the rod lens 4 in the<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> casing, the notch portions 52 of the rod lens 4 and the projected rim parts 51 of the casing 2 are brought into contact with each other, whereby the rod lens 4 is vertically and laterally positioned with respect to the casing 2. It is noted that, in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 4</figref>, shown is a case where the front side wall 24 is attached to the left and right side walls 22 and 23 of the casing 2 in a step of accommodating the LED substrate 3 and rod lens 4.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Then, the silicon tubes 54 serving as the two elastic bodies are fit into the concave grooves of the left and right side walls 22 and 23 (elastic body fitting process). In this fitting work, after the silicon tube 54 is arranged in a gap between the upper end portion of each concave groove 53 and the side peripheral surface of the rod lens 4, the silicon tube 54 is fitted into each of the concave grooves 53 using a jig.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Here, the jig J includes a jig main body J1 having a tip surface which contacts with the silicon tube 54 and a guide part J2 provided in the jig main body J1 and contacting with the upper surface of the casing 2. Specifically, the jig main body J1 is a main body roller R rotatable about a rotation axis, and the guide part J2 is a guide roller R1 provided coaxially with the rotation axis of the main body roller R. The main body roller R has its one side surface Ra forming a plane shape and the other side surface Rb including a tapered surface Rb1. Further, the guide roller R1 contacts with the upper surface of the casing 2, whereby a position of a side peripheral end surface Rc of the main body roller R is rendered to be a fitting position where the silicon tube 54 is fit to the concave groove 53.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Then, in a state that one of the side surface Ra of the main body roller R is along the inner side surface of the casing 2, by rolling the guide roller R1 being in contact with the upper surface of the casing 2, the side peripheral end surface Rc which is a tip surface of the main body roller R contacts with the silicon tube 54 and the silicon tube 54 can be fit into the concave groove 53 by pressing in the silicon tube 54 from the upper portion. Further, since the other side surface Rb of the main body roller R has a tapered surface Rb1, the main body roller R does not contact with the side peripheral surface of the rod lens 4 in the fitting process of the silicon tube 54. Thus, the silicon tube 54 is fit to the concave groove 53,<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> and the notch portion 52 of the rod lens 4 is pressed to be in a state of being fixed to the projected rim part 51 of each of the left and right side wall parts 22 and 23 by an elastic return force thereof. Here, the shortest distance (a code "d" in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>) between the upper end portion of the concave groove 53 and the side peripheral surface of the rod lens 4 is set to be smaller than the outer diameter of the silicon tube 54 in a natural state (in a state of not being deformed by an external force). Thus, the silicon tube 54 fit to the concave groove 53 is prevented from being detached from the concave groove 53. Here, the guide roller R1 is attached to the roller R, and by contacting this guide roller R1 with the upper surface of each of the side wall parts 22 and 23 and rolling the roller R along the inner surface of each of the side wall parts 22 and 23, the tip portion of the roller R presses the silicon tube 54 into the concave groove 53.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Moreover, in the assembling step, the silicon tube 54 is partly rendered to protrude to a side of the front side wall 25. And the protruded portion is pulled outward in the longitudinal direction and a proximal portion of the protruded portion is cut off. Thus, the silicon tube 54 in the concave groove 53 shrinks inward in the longitudinal direction and is rendered to be coplanar with the end surface of the rod lens 4 or enter inside thereof. Thus, when the rear side wall 25 is fixed to each of the left and right side walls 22 and 23, the silicon tube 54 is prevented from becoming an obstacle.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">And after fitting the silicon tube 54 to fix the rod lens 4, the light transmission plate 6 is slid to be attached to the slide groove 7, and thereafter the rear side wall 25 is fixed to each of the left and right side walls 22 and 23 with screws to thereby assemble the line light irradiation device 100.</p><heading id="h0010">&lt;Effect of the Present Embodiment&gt;</heading><p id="p0040" num="0040">According to the line light irradiation device 100 according to the present embodiment configured like this, the fixing mechanism 5 includes the projected rim part 51 provided in the inner surface of each of the left and right side wall parts 22 and 23 and the notch portion 52 provided in the side peripheral surface of the rod lens 4, and by contacting between these upward surface 51a and the downward surface 52a, the rod lens 4 can be fixed to the casing 2 while positioning<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> the rod lens 4 to the casing 2 in the vertical direction.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Further, since the fixing mechanism 5 includes the concave groove 53 and the elastic body 54 which is fitted to this concave groove 53 to press the side peripheral surface of the rod lens 4, the rod lens 4 can be fixed to the casing 2 while preventing looseness of the rod lens 4 to the casing 2.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Furthermore, the contact between the casing 2 and the rod lens 4 is performed only between the upward surface 51a of the projected rim part 51 and the downward surface 52a of the notch portion 52, and even though the rod lens 4 is moved by sliding in the longitudinal direction, a light transmission portion of the rod lens 4 is not damaged.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Moreover, after contacting the downward surface 52a of the notch portion 52 with the upward surface 51a of the projected rim part 51, the rod lens 4 can be fixed by pressing to the casing 2 only by fitting the elastic body 54 to the concave groove 53, and therefore the assembling work can be facilitated. At this time, since the elastic body 54 is not fitted to the concave groove 53 at the time of attaching the rod lens 4 to the casing 2, the attachment work of the rod lens 4 to the casing 2 can be facilitated.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">In addition, since the casing 2 is integrally formed, not only the number of assembling man-hours can be reduced but also heat dissipation performance of the casing 2 can be improved.
