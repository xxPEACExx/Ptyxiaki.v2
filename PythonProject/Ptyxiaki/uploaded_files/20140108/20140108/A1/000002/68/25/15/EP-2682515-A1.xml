This rigid tubular body may be furthermore structured for resting on a number of idle supporting rollers which are arranged at the two axial<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> ends of the tubular body locally parallel to the drum longitudinal reference axis, and are fixed to the boxlike casing in free revolving manner so as to allow the tubular body to freely rotate about its horizontally-oriented longitudinal reference axis. The circular front rim of the tubular body surrounds the laundry loading/unloading opening and is coupled in substantially airtight and axially rotating manner to the front wall of the boxlike casing; whereas the circular rear rim of the tubular body abuts against the rear wall of the boxlike casing and is coupled in substantially airtight and axially rotating manner directly to said rear wall.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The closed-circuit, hot-air generator in turn comprises: an air recirculating conduit which extends on the bottom of the boxlike casing and has a first end directly connected to a first air-vent realized in the rear wall of the boxlike casing, within the perimeter of the rear rim of the tubular body, and a second end directly connected to a second air-vent realized on the annular frame that delimits the laundry loading/unloading opening on the front wall of the appliance casing; and an electrically-powered centrifugal fan which is located along the air recirculating conduit and is structured to produce an airflow which flows in closed loop through the air recirculating conduit and the rotatable drum.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The stream of hot air produced by the hot-air generator generally enters into the tubular body via the first air-vent realized in the rear wall of the boxlike casing, flows inside the tubular body for the entire length of the latter, and finally comes out of the tubular body via the second air-vent realized on the annular frame that delimits the laundry loading/unloading opening on the front wall of the casing.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The closed-circuit, hot-air generator furthermore comprises: an air-cooling device which is located along the air recirculating conduit, and is structured to cool the moist air arriving from the rotatable drum, so as to cause the condensation of the surplus moisture inside the airflow; an air-heating device which is located along the air recirculating conduit, downstream of the air-cooling device, and which is structured for heating the dehumidified airflow arriving from the air-cooling device and directed back to the rotatable drum, so that the airflow directed back into the rotatable drum is heated to a temperature preferably, though not necessarily, higher<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> than or equal to that of the moist air flowing out of the same rotatable drum.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The closed-circuit, hot-air generator is finally provided with an air-filtering member which is arranged along the air recirculating conduit, upstream of the air-cooling device, to prevent the fluff and/or lint particles from reaching and clogging up the air-cooling device, the air-heating device and the centrifugal fan.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In some of the rotary-drum household laundry dryers currently on the market, the air-filtering member consists in a substantially wedge-shaped filtering cartridge which is fitted in removable manner into the air-vent realized on the annular frame that delimits the laundry loading/unloading opening on the front wall of the casing, so as to cover/close the whole air-vent. When the porthole door is in the wide-opened position, the user is allowed to manually extract the wedge-shaped filtering cartridge from the air-vent realized on the annular frame that delimits the laundry loading/unloading opening for periodical cleaning.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010"><patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="DE8437357U1"><text>DE8437357U1</text></patcit> discloses a wedge-like air-filtering cartridge for laundry driers which is dimensioned for being inserted/plugged into the air-vent realized on the annular frame that delimits the laundry loading/unloading opening, so as to cover/close the whole air-vent, and is structured to restrain the fluff and/or lint particles in suspension into the airflow. This air-filtering cartridge basically consists in a substantially bag- or pocket-shaped air-filtering rigid shell which has a substantially V-shaped cross section and is dimensioned for being inserted/plugged into the air-vent realized on the annular frame that delimits the laundry loading/unloading opening, so as to cover/close the whole air-vent.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The bag-shaped shell is furthermore divided into two complementary valve-like pieces which are laterally hinged to one another at the bottom of the bag- or pocket-shaped air-filtering rigid shell, so that the rigid shell is openable in a book-like manner; and each valve-like piece is provided with a substantially flat, large permeable-to-air sidewall which is structured to restrain the fluff and/or lint particles within the bag-shaped rigid shell.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">To improve the air filtering performances, in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="DE8437357U1"><text>DE8437357U1</text></patcit> the wedge-like air-filtering cartridge furthermore comprises two substantially flat, additional<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> permeable-to-air panels, each of which is structured to restrain the fluff and/or lint particles and is hinged to the upper edge of a respective valve-like piece of the bag-or pocket-shaped air-filtering shell, so as to be foldable towards the inside of the bag-or pocket-shaped air-filtering shell for covering the whole permeable-to-air sidewall of the same valve-like piece, thus improving the air-filtering capabilities.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Unluckily, periodical cleaning of the <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="DE8437357U1"><text>DE8437357U1</text></patcit> wedge-like filtering cartridge is particularly unpleasant to the user because the particular structure of the filtering cartridge allows the fluff and/or lint particles to accumulate on faces of the permeable-to-air sidewalls of the two valve-like pieces and of the permeable-to-air panels hinged to the same valve-like pieces that result to be placed on opposite sides when the filter in unfolded, i.e. opened in a book-like manner, thus creating several problems at opening of the filtering cartridge.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Aim of the present invention is to provide a laundry dryer having an air-filtering cartridge which is easier to clean.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In compliance with the above aims, according to the present invention there is provided a laundry dryer having an air-filtering cartridge as claimed in Claim 1 and preferably, though not necessarily, in any one of the dependent Claims.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">A non-limiting embodiment of the present invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:
