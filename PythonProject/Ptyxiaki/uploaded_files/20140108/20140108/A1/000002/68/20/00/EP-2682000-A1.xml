Furthermore, it is possible to bring out more sweetness by adding whey powder to the raw-material milk, because lactose contained in the whey powder is degraded by lactase. In addition, because lactose is basically degraded, problems relating to lactose intolerance are less likely to occur.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Furthermore, since whey powder contains high concentration of salts such as potassium salt and sodium salt, a sourness-masking effect by salts can be expected and sweetness can be brought out effectively. Also, due to the unique flavor of whey protein, it is possible not only to increase sweetness, but also to suppress sourness; namely, it is possible to simultaneously adjust the balance between sweetness and sourness of the fermented milk. Since even a small quantity of whey powder can exert its effects, addition of a whey powder in the fermented milk does not adversely affect the quality of products.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In addition, as compared to conventional lactose degradation processing, production of fermented milk with sufficient sweetness in a short time becomes possible.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In addition, since the sweetness/sourness balance of the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> fermented milk of the present invention is superior to that of the conventional production method, yogurt drinks in which sweetness is more preferred than sourness can be provided without addition of a sweetener after fermentation.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Furthermore, using hard-type yogurt that has strong sourness and therefore that had been hardly used for yogurt drinks, it becomes possible to produce palatable yogurt drinks without addition of sweeteners. Therefore, the present invention enables to provide palatable yogurt drinks having novel flavors with adjusted balance between sweetness and sourness, without addition of sweeteners.</p><heading id="h0009"><b>[Description of Embodiments]</b></heading><p id="p0015" num="0015">The production method of a fermented milk of the present invention comprises a step of blending a whey powder into a raw-material milk (whey-powder blending step), and a step of degrading the lactose in the raw-material milk using lactase (lactose degradation step).</p><heading id="h0010"><u>Fermented milk</u></heading><p id="p0016" num="0016">In the present specification, "fermented milk" includes "fermented milks", "dairy product/lactic acid bacteria beverages", and "lactic acid bacteria beverages" defined in the Ministerial Ordinance on Milk and Dairy products Concerning Compositional Standards, etc. (Ministerial Ordinance on Milk, etc.), and it also includes yogurts, etc.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">For example, fermented milk refers to milk such as raw milk, cow's milk, special milk, raw goat milk, sterilized goat milk, raw sheep milk, component adjustment milk, low fat milk, non-fat milk and processed milk, or milk and others that contain non-fat<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> milk solid equal to or greater than that of the milk, which is fermented with lactic acid bacteria or yeasts, then made into a paste or liquid condition, or a frozen product thereof; fermented milk includes hard yogurt, soft yogurt (paste-like fermented milk) or yogurt drinks (liquid fermented milk).</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Preferred fermented milk in the present invention is a yogurt drink.

As used herein, the term "whey powder" includes the following: a milk fermented with lactic acid bacteria, or a milk to which an enzyme or acid is added to make a whey, from which most of the moisture is removed, then triturated. Whey is, for example, a water-soluble component that remains in the cow' s milk after fat, casein and lipid-soluble vitamins are removed. Whey generally refers to cheese whey or<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> rennet whey (or also referred to as sweet whey) obtained as a by-product upon production of natural cheese or rennet casein; it also refers to casein whey and quark whey (or also referred to as acid whey) obtained upon production of acid casein or quark from skim milk. Main components of the whey are protein (β-lactoglobulin, α-lactalbumin, etc.), lactose, water-soluble vitamins, salts (mineral components).</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">"Whey-related products" include the following: whey concentrate obtained by concentration of a whey; whey powder obtained by drying a whey, whey protein concentrate (also referred to as WPC) obtained by concentration of major proteins of a whey with ultrafiltration method, etc., then drying; defatted WPC (low fat and high protein) obtained by removing fats from a whey with microfiltration (MF) method or centrifugation method, then concentration by UF method and drying; whey protein isolate (also referred to as WPI) obtained by selective fractionation of major proteins of a whey by ion exchange resin and gel filtration, then drying; desalted whey obtained by desalting a whey with nanofiltration (NF) or electrodialysis, then drying; mineral-concentrated whey obtained by precipitation of mineral components derived from a whey, then concentration by centrifugation, etc.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In addition, it is possible to add a composition comprising whey or whey components so that the formulation becomes identical to that of the whey powder. For example, a whey concentrate that is a whey concentrated and made into a solid form may be used. It is also possible to use a whey protein concentrate, that is a lactose-removed whey from which most of the moisture is removed then triturated.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In the present invention, whey powder is preferably used. Whey powder is blended in the raw-material milk in a ratio of preferably 1.0%-4.0% inclusive, more preferably 1.5%-3.0% inclusive. Furthermore preferably, it is blended in a ratio of 1.7%-2.8% inclusive, more preferably 1.8%-2.3% inclusive. When the blending amount of the whey powder is large, sweetness derived from lactose is sensed strongly, and at the same time, flavors of whey proteins and saltiness derived from the whey powder are significantly generated, resulting in the deterioration of the flavor of fermented milk; accordingly, an effect to induce subtle sweetness intended by the present invention is weakened. In addition, when the blending amount of a whey powder is large, astringency derived from whey proteins is strongly sensed, and therefore product quality is often adversely affected; whereas when the blending amount is too small, the effect of adjusting sweetness and sourness is hardly expected.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The whey powder used in the present invention may be a sweet whey powder, desalted whey powder and concentrated whey powder, and sweet whey powder is preferably used.

Fermentation step of raw-material milk may be two-stage fermentation, etc. Fermented milk with a commercial value can be obtained through the fermentation step. In the present invention, preferably, fermentation is carried out by blending a starter to raw-material milk.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">As a starter, known starters may be appropriately used. Preferable starters include lactic acid bacteria starter, and as the lactic acid bacteria starter, in addition to Lactobacillus bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus), Streptococcus thermophilus (S. thermophilus), Lactobacillus lactis (L.lactis), Lactobacillus gasseri (L gasseri) or Bifidobacterium, one or more kinds selected from lactic acid bacteria and yeasts that are generally used for production of fermented milk may be used.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Among these, a starter based on the mixed starter of<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> Lactobacillus bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus) and Streptococcus thermophilus (S. thermophilus) that are standardized as yogurt starters in accordance with the Codex Alimentarius international food standards is preferred. Using this yogurt starter as a base, other lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus gasseri (L gasseri) and Bifidobacterium may be added as well, depending on the fermented milk to be obtained. As the amount of addition of starters, the amount adopted in known production methods of fermented milk may be appropriately adopted. The inoculation method of starters may be in accordance with a known method used for the production of fermented milk.</p><heading id="h0014"><u>Lactose degradation step</u></heading><p id="p0041" num="0041">"Lactose degradation step" is a process wherein lactose is broken down by lactase. Lactase may be added at any stage of the production process. Lactase may be added to raw-material milk and/or whey powder.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">In general, from the viewpoint of reducing the risk of bacterial contamination, heat sterilization is carried out to inactivate or kill the enzymes after degradation of lactose at low temperature, and fermentation is promoted thereafter.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Meanwhile in the present invention, it is possible that in the fermentation step, a starter and lactase may be mixed into a yogurt mix (raw-material milk) and they are subjected to fermentation while enzymes are in an activated condition. Here, lactose, etc. contained in the raw-material milk is degraded, resulting in the generation of acid to inactivate the enzymes. Owing to such treatment, lactose degradation rate can be effectively increased.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044"><!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> In addition, when fermentation is carried out by mixing a starter and lactase into the raw-material milk, because it is not necessary to promote enzymatic reaction before high-temperature heat sterilization, production process of fermented milk can be simplified, and flavors inherent to fermented milk can be maximally brought out. Moreover, since such a treatment enables to effectively increase the lactose degradation rate, separate control of the lactose degradation rate and degree of fermentation (change in acidity) is not necessary, and the product control can be extremely simplified.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Therefore, in the present invention, lactase is preferably added to raw-material milk together with a starter. However, lactase may be added before addition of a fermentation starter, or may be simultaneously with, or after addition of a fermentation starter. When the raw-material milk to which lactase and a starter are mixed is used, lactose in the raw-material milk is degraded during the time course of the fermentation step.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">In addition, lactase may be added before deoxidation step, or after deoxidation step.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Preferably, lactase in the present invention is an enzyme whose optimal pH of activity is in the neutral region, which inactivates in the acidic region, and which can degrade lactose at its activated condition. An example of such an enzyme is a lactase disclosed in Patent Document 3. Examples of the lactase include those of bacterial origin or yeast origin. Also, those wherein the optimal pH of activity is 6.3-7.5 inclusive and the pH for inactivation is 6.0 or more and 4.0 or less are included. Furthermore, as the lactase, a lactase derived from Kluyveromyces<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> lactis or from Kluyveromyces fragilis is preferred. Lactase derived from Kluyveromyces lactis includes Kluyveromyces lactis itself, and a lactase derived from Kluyveromyces lactis. Incidentally, lactases are commercially available, and examples of commercially available lactase include Lactase F (Amano Enzyme Inc.), Lactoles L-3 (Daiwa Fine Chemicals Co. , Ltd.), and Lactoles L-10 (Daiwa Fine Chemicals Co., Ltd.).</p><heading id="h0015"><u>Fermentation and lactose degradation condition</u></heading><p id="p0048" num="0048">Fermentation conditions such as fermentation temperature may be adjusted as appropriate in consideration of the type of lactic acid bacteria added to the raw-material milk and desired flavor of the fermented milk. One specific example is to maintain the temperature of a fermentation chamber (fermentation temperature) from 30°C or more to 50°C or less. At this temperature, lactic acid bacteria are usually active, and therefore fermentation can be promoted effectively. Fermentation temperature is, more preferably 40°C-45°C inclusive, and furthermore preferably 41°C-44°C inclusive.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">Fermentation time may be appropriately adjusted depending on the type of starters and fermentation temperature; specifically, it is from 1 hr or more to 5 hr or less; it may be from 2 hr or more to 4 hr or less.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">Furthermore, when the lactose degradation rate of raw materials is 65% or more, generally a fermented milk with good flavor can be obtained. However, according to the production method of the present invention, the balance between sweetness and sourness is adjusted by the addition of whey powder, and sufficient sweetness is obtained even if lactose degradation rate<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> is low. Therefore, in the present invention, it becomes possible to employ the lactose degradation rate of 30% or more to 100% or less; however, in order to increase sweetness, it may be from 60% or more to 100% or less.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">In addition, lactose degradation step of the raw material may be carried out before sterilization, or simultaneously with fermentation. In general, a temperature at the time of lactose degradation may be 0°C-55°C inclusive at which lactase maintains its activity, and preferably 30°C-50°C inclusive, and more preferably 40°C-45°C inclusive. When the lactose degradation time is 1 hr or more at a preferable temperature of common lactase from 40°C or more to 45°C or less, then the object can be achieved. However, according to the present invention, lactose degradation time can be shortened compared to conventional methods, and the lactose degradation time at 40°C or more to 45°C or less may be 15 min-1 hr inclusive, and preferably 30 min-45 min inclusive.</p><heading id="h0016"><u>Flavor of fermented milk</u></heading><p id="p0052" num="0052">As used herein, "sweetness/sourness balance" is a term representing the balance of the strength between sweetness and sourness, which is also one of the indices of taste.
