Catheters are used for many different applications within the human body including the administration of liquid therapeutic agents and the removal of bodily fluids for testing, monitoring, treatment or disposal. Catheters have a particular application in hemodialysis procedures, in which blood is withdrawn from a blood vessel, directed to a hemodialysis unit for dialysis or purification, and subsequently returned to the blood vessel.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Typically, chronic catheters remain implanted within the body for extended periods of time. Because of this, clotting and thrombus formation within the catheter lumen or lumens can be problematic. To minimize the potential problems which may result from thrombus formation within the catheter lumen(s), it is common to "lock" the catheter during periods of non-use, such as an interdialytic period. Locking typically involves flushing the catheter with saline to remove blood and other fluids from the catheter lumen(s) and injecting an anticoagulant solution, for example, heparin, into the catheter to fill the lumen(s). The anticoagulant solution displaces any blood that may remain in the lumen(s) and actively inhibits thrombus formation within the lumen(s) of the catheter.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">One problem associated with known catheters is that during periods of non-use, such as the interdialytic period, the anticoagulant in the distal end of the catheter lumen tends to partially drain from the lumen such that blood is able to enter the distal end of the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> catheter. This stagnant blood within the distal end of the catheter results in thrombus formation at the distal end of the catheter lumen.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">It would be desirable to provide a catheter that is configured to retain an anticoagulant within the catheter lumen(s) during the periods of non-use to prevent thrombus formation within the catheter. It would also be desirable to provide a catheter that is configured to prevent the inflow of blood into the catheter lumen(s) during periods of non-use to prevent thrombosis formation without the use of a locking solution, such as heparin.</p><heading id="h0003"><b><u>SUMMARY</u></b></heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">A catheter is disclosed which includes a body defining first and second lumens and at least one distally located normally closed, one-way valve associated with each of the first and second lumens. Each of the distally located one-way valves is configured to open in response to an increase in pressure within a respective one of the first and second lumens to enable fluid to be discharged from the respective first or second lumen. The catheter also includes at least one proximally located normally closed, one-way valve associated with each of the first and second lumens. Each of the proximally located one-way valves is spaced proximally of the distally located one-way valves and is configured to open in response to a decrease in pressure within a respective one of the first and second lumens to enable fluid to enter the respective first or second lumen.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In one embodiment, each of the distally located one-way valves and each of the proximally located one-way valves is a slit valve.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The catheter may include support structure formed in the body adjacent at least one of the proximally located one-way valves.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In one embodiment, each of the proximally located one-way valves includes tapered inwardly deformable flaps. Alternatively, each of the proximally located one-way valves may include a slit which extends through the body and includes a concavity formed about the slit. In yet another embodiment, the proximally located one-way valves may include<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> a flap valve including a deformable flap. The deformable flap can be rectangular, triangular or assume any of a variety of other configurations.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In one embodiment, each of the proximally located one-way valves is a duckbill valve.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In another embodiment, the body comprises separated tip portions wherein each of the separated tip portions includes at least one of the distally located one-way valves and/or at least one of the proximally located one-way valves. Alternatively, the proximally located one-way valves may be formed in the body proximally of the separated tip portions.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In one embodiment, each of the proximally located one-way valves includes a membrane supported within the respective one of the first and second lumens of the body. The membrane is positioned to cover a throughbore formed in the body and is inwardly movable to enable fluid to enter the throughbore. At least a portion of the membrane is secured to the body. A support rib may be provided to extend across the throughbore to prevent outward movement of the membrane.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">A catheter assembly is also disclosed which includes a catheter including a body defining a venous lumen and an arterial lumen wherein a distal end of the venous lumen extends distally beyond a distal end of the arterial lumen. A one-way valve is formed in the distal end of the venous lumen and is configured to enable fluid to be discharged from the venous lumen upon an increase in pressure within the venous lumen. A one-way valve is also formed in the distal end of the arterial lumen and is configured to enable fluid to enter the arterial lumen upon a decrease in pressure within the arterial lumen.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In one embodiment, a catheter hub is secured to a proximal end of the catheter body. The catheter hub supports a valve assembly having two inlet one-way valves which communicate with the venous lumen and enable fluid to flow into the venous lumen and two outlet one-way valves which communicate with the arterial lumen and enable fluid to flow from the arterial lumen. A conduit adapted to communicate with a medical device<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> defines first and second lumens and has a first end connected to the catheter hub such that each of the first and second lumens communicate with one of the inlet one-way valves and one of the outlet one-way valves.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">A catheter is also disclosed which comprises a body defining at least one lumen including a proximal body portion and a distal body portion. The distal body portion is formed of an elastomeric material including at least one perforation. The distal portion is stretchable from a first unbiased state wherein the at least one perforation is sealed to a second biased state wherein the at least one perforation defines an opening. A push rod is supported within the catheter body and is movable from a retracted position to an advanced position to move the distal portion from its unbiased state to its biased state. In one embodiment, the catheter body includes a channel dimensioned to slidably receive the push rod. The channel includes a closed distal end positioned to engage a distal end of the push rod.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">A catheter is also disclosed which comprises a body defining first and second lumens, and at least one distally located normally closed, one-way valve in fluid communication with at least one of the first and second lumens. Each of the distally located one-way valves being configured to open in response to an increase in pressure within the respective first and second lumens to which the distally located one-way valve is in fluid communication to enable fluid to be discharged from the respective first or second lumen. At least one proximally located normally closed, one-way valve is also in fluid communication with at least one of the first and second lumens. Each of the proximally located one-way valves is spaced proximally of the distally located one-way valves and is configured to open in response to a decrease in pressure within the respective first and second lumens to which the proximally located one-way valve is in fluid communication to enable fluid to enter the respective first or second lumen.</p><heading id="h0004"><b><u>Brief Description of the Drawings</u></b></heading><!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --><p id="p0017" num="0017">Various embodiments of the presently disclosed valved tip catheter will be described herein with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein:

The portion of body 12 defining the venous lumen 16 extends distally of the portion of the body 12 defining the arterial lumen 14 such that a distal opening 14a of the arterial lumen 14 is positioned proximally of a distal opening 16a of the venous lumen 16.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In use, blood is withdrawn from a patient through the arterial lumen 14 and delivered to a dialyzer (not shown) wherein toxins are removed from the blood. Thereafter, the blood is returned to the patient through the venous lumen 16. The spacing between the distal opening 14a of the arterial lumen 14 and the distal opening 16a of the venous lumen 16 minimizes the degree of recirculation of blood within the catheter. As used herein, "recirculation" is defined as the flow of purified blood exiting the venous lumen 16 directly into the arterial lumen 14.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">During periods of non-use, such as the period between dialysis treatments, a lock solution or anticoagulant, such as heparin, is typically injected into the arterial and venous lumens 14 and 16 to prevent thrombus formation. Because the catheter body 12 defines arterial and venous lumens 14 and 16 which have open ends 14a and 16a, respectively, in fluid<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> communication with flowing blood in a bloodstream, the lock solution has a tendency to leak from the distal end of the arterial and venous lumens 14 and 16. When this occurs, blood is able to flow into and stagnate within the distal end of the arterial and venous lumens 14 and 16. This commonly results in the formation of thrombosis which may partially or completely occlude blood flow to or from the catheter 10. Because the venous lumen 16 extends distally of the arterial lumen 14, the flow cannot be reversed by switching the communication of the arterial and venous lumens with the dialyzer, to potentially dislodge the thrombosis, without greatly increasing recirculation. Yet further, thrombus is expensive to treat once it has formed. Treatment of thrombus by flushing the catheter with heparinized saline is typically insufficient. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is generally employed to dissolve the thrombus. However, each use of tPA is very expensive. More importantly, however, thrombus can lead to failure of the catheter requiring catheter removal and all the inherent concerns associated with catheter removal, such as patient discomfort, potential for infection and/or scarring, etc.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023"><figref idrefs="f0002">Figures 2-3B</figref> illustrate one embodiment of the presently disclosed catheter comprising a valved tip, which is shown generally as 100. Catheter 100 includes a body 112 which defines first and second lumens 114 and 116. Unlike prior art catheter 10, the catheter 100 is reversible such that either one of the first and second lumens 114 and 116 can function as the arterial lumen or the venous lumen as will be discussed in further detail below. The body 112 defines at least two distal one-way valves 118 and at least two proximal one-way valves 120. More specifically, at a minimum, one distal one-way valve 118 and one proximal one-way valve 120 are employed for each catheter lumen 114 and 116. Each of the distal and proximal one-way valves 118 and 120, respectively, are normally closed and extend through outer walls of the catheter body 112 along an axis transverse to the longitudinal axis of the catheter body 112. At least one of the distal one-way valves 118 and at least one of the proximal one-way valves 120 communicates with each of the first and second body lumens 114 and 116. The distal one-way valves 118 are configured to open outwardly in response to an increase in pressure within a respective lumen 114 or 116 to enable fluid to exit the first or second body lumen 114 or 116 (<figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3B</figref>). In contrast, the proximal one-way valves 120 are configured to open inwardly in<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> response to a decrease in pressure within a respective lumen to enable fluid to enter the first or the second body lumen 114 or 116. While the pressure differentials have been described as increases and decreases in pressure within the lumens, any pressure differential between the lumen and the exterior environment of the catheter may be used to open or close the valves 118, 120. Although two distal one-way valves 118 and four proximal one-way valves 120 are illustrated, it is envisioned that two or more distal and proximal one-way valves can be provided in body 112. For example, the body 112 may have four distal valves 118 and six proximal valves 120 or two distal valves 118 and two proximal valves 120. The number and sizes of the valves 118, 120 may be configured to enable the desired flow rates through the catheter 100. Also, the first lumen 114 may include a single distal one-way valve 118 only and the second lumen may include a single proximal one-way valve 120 only.

As discussed above, at least one distal one-way valve 418 and one proximal one-way valve 420 communicates with each of the first and second lumens.

Catheter 500 is similar to the prior art catheter 10 shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, but also includes one-way valves as will be discussed in further detail below. Catheter 500 includes a body 512 defining an arterial lumen 514 and a venous lumen 516. The body 512 defining the distal end of the venous lumen 516 extends distally beyond the distal end of the arterial lumen 514. The distal end of the arterial lumen 514 is sealed by an inwardly deformable one-way valve 518. Similarly, the distal end of the venous lumen 516 is enclosed by a outwardly deformable one-way valve 520. As illustrated, the thickness of the body 512 approaching the one-way valve 520 may become progressively thinner to facilitate operation of valve 520. When the catheter 500 is connected to a medical device, such as a dialyzer, fluid is withdrawn from a patient through the arterial lumen 514, delivered to the dialyzer for purification, and returned to the patient through the venous lumen 516. The one-way valves 518 and 520 open inwardly and outwardly, respectively, in response to a change in pressure within the arterial and venous lumens 514 and 516. During periods of non-use, such as during the period between dialysis treatments, valves 518 and 520 are normally closed to retain a lock solution, such as an anticoagulant, within the catheter lumens 514 and 516.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Referring also to <figref idrefs="f0008 f0009 f0010 f0011">FIGS. 8C-8G</figref>, one-way valves 518 and 520 prevent the use of catheter 500 in a reversible manner. More specifically, because one-way valve 520 only opens outwardly and one-way valve 518 only opens inwardly, the lumen 516 will only function as the venous lumen and the lumen 514 will only function as the arterial lumen. In order to ensure that the catheter 500 is properly connected to a medical device, a hub member 552 including a valve assembly 550 may be provided at a proximal end 502 of catheter body 512. In one embodiment, the valve assembly 550 includes two inwardly opening one-way valves 554 and two outwardly opening one-way valves 556. One side of each of the inwardly opening valves 554 communicates with a proximal end of the venous lumen 516 and one side of each of the outwardly opening one-way valves 556 communicates<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> with the proximal end of the arterial lumen 514.

The extension tubes 570a and 570b connecting the proximal end 502 of the catheter 500 to the medical device (not shown) define two lumens 560 and 562, respectively. Lumen 560 which is provided for withdrawing fluid from the catheter 500 and delivering the fluid to a medical device, communicates with the other side of one of each of valves 554 and 556. Similarly, the lumen 562 is provided for supplying fluid to the catheter 500 from the medical device and communicates with the other side of one of each of valves 554 and 556.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In use, withdrawal lumen 560 is in fluid communication with one of valves 554 and one of valves 556 and supply lumen 562 is in communication with the other one of valves 554 and valves 556.

If, due to clinician error, the conduit 570 is incorrectly secured to the medical device, the valve assembly 550 will ensure fluid flow to and from the catheter 500 will occur along the desired arterial and venous lumens 514 and 516 of catheter body 512.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 8G</figref>, valve assembly 550 may be replaced with a manually operated spool valve 580 which can be manually actuated to ensure that fluid flow to and from the medical device is directed to the appropriate arterial and venous lumens 514' and 516' of the catheter 500'.
