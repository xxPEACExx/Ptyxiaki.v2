DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">There are known conventional image acquisition apparatuss in which two imaging devices are included, and light collected by an objective lens is split to be guided to the imaging devices via different optical elements, thereby acquiring two images having different characteristics at the same time (for example, see Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, Publication No. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JPHEI09186917B"><text>Hei 09-186917</text></patcit>).</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">With an image acquisition apparatus disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP9186917A"><text>Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, Publication No. Hei 09-186917</text></patcit>, in order to acquire high-definition images, it is necessary to adopt a large imaging device with higher resolution or an imaging device with a small pixel pitch.</p><heading id="h0004">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">According to one aspect, the present invention provides an image acquisition apparatus including: a light-path setting member for making incident light enter two or more light paths; two or more different-characteristics imaging devices<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> that acquire images of light entering the light paths set by the light-path setting member; and a moving means to which at least one of the two or more imaging devices is attached and that minutely moves the imaging device in a direction perpendicular to an optical axis.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">According to this aspect, the incident light is made to enter two or more light paths by the light-path setting member and is imaged by the different-characteristics imaging devices disposed in the light paths, thereby making it possible to observe an object in two or more different ways suitable for the observation method. In this case, the moving means is actuated to minutely move at least one imaging device attached to the moving means in a direction perpendicular to the optical axis, thereby increasing the pseudo number of pixels of the imaging device and acquiring a high-definition image. Because neither the size of the imaging device itself nor the number of pixels is increased, a high-definition image can be acquired at low cost while achieving a reduction in the apparatus size and a reduction in the incident light level.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In the above-described aspect, the imaging device that is disposed in the light path having the shortest geometric optical-path length, among the light paths, may be attached to the moving means.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">By doing so, deterioration of information about the incident light until it reaches the imaging device is<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> minimized, thus making it possible to acquire a higher-definition image.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Furthermore, in the above-described aspect, the light-path setting member may be provided in a manner capable of being inserted into and removed from a light path of the incident light.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">By doing so, by inserting/removing the light-path setting member into/from the light path of the incident light, it is possible to switch the light path in which the incident light passes and to make all of the incident light enter the imaging device disposed in each of the light paths.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Furthermore, in the above-described aspect, the light-path setting member may be disposed in a light path of the incident light and may split the light path into two or more.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">By doing so, with the two or more imaging devices disposed in the two or more light paths, two or more different-characteristics images of an identical object can be acquired at the same time.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Furthermore, in the above-described aspect, the light-path setting member may have two reflecting surfaces that are parallel to each other and that reflect the incident light.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">By doing so, when the light-path setting member is inserted/removed into/from the light path of the incident light, two light paths to be switched can be set accurately parallel to each other. Furthermore, when the light-path<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> setting member is disposed in the light path of the incident light to split the incident light, two light paths obtained after the splitting can be set accurately parallel to each other. Thus, two imaging devices to be disposed in the light paths can be arranged side-by-side, thus making it possible to construct the image acquisition apparatus compactly.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Furthermore, in the above-described aspect, the two or more imaging devices may have imaging surfaces located on different planes.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">By doing so, the difference in the optical path length between two or more different light paths is compensated for, and incident light is converged on the imaging surfaces of the imaging devices, thus making it possible to acquire sharp images.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Furthermore, in the above-described aspect, a light path for at least one of the imaging devices may be aligned with a light path of the incident light.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">By doing so, by making incident light enter at least one imaging device via the straight light path, deterioration of information about the incident light until it reaches the imaging device is minimized, thus making it possible to acquire a higher-definition image.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Furthermore, in the above-described aspect, an accommodating section in which the imaging devices are disposed in a space that is sealed in an air-sealed state may<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> be further included.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">By doing so, the occurrence of condensation in the imaging devices can be prevented.</p><heading id="h0005">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0020" num="0020"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram showing the overall configuration of a microscope on which an image acquisition apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention is mounted.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a longitudinal sectional view showing the image acquisition apparatus according to this embodiment to be mounted on the microscope shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is a transverse sectional view, cutting through a chassis, showing a swivel mechanism disposed in a space above an intermediate plate in the image acquisition apparatus shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref> is a view showing a prism and imaging devices disposed in a space below the intermediate plate in the image acquisition apparatus shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5</figref> is a perspective view for explaining a moving means on which the two imaging devices provided in the image acquisition apparatus shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> are to be fixed.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 6A</figref> is a view for explaining an optical path length up to a color CCD provided in the image acquisition apparatus shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 6B</figref> is a view for explaining an optical path length<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> up to a monochrome CCD provided in the image acquisition apparatus shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0021" num="0021">An image acquisition apparatus 1 according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to the drawings.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The image acquisition apparatus 1 of this embodiment is used for a microscope (observation apparatus) 2.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the microscope 2 includes a stage 3 on which a specimen A is positionally placed and that is provided so as to be movable in the vertical direction, an objective lens 4 that enlarges an image of the specimen A placed on the stage 3, an imaging lens (not shown), and an eyepiece 5 used for visual observation.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the image acquisition apparatus 1 of this embodiment includes a chassis 6 and a connecting part 7 used to detachably attach the chassis 6 to the microscope 2. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, for example, the connecting part 7 is provided with a dovetail 9 to be engaged with a dovetail groove 8 provided in the microscope 2. The connecting part 7 is not limited to the dovetail 9 and the dovetail groove 8, and another desired connecting method can be adopted.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Furthermore, the image acquisition apparatus 1 of this embodiment includes an opening 10 that is provided in the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> connecting part 7 and that allows light from the specimen A collected by the microscope 2 to enter the chassis 6, two imaging devices 11 and 12 for imaging light that has entered along an entrance optical axis X via the opening 10, a light-path switching means 13 for switching between light paths from the opening 10 to the imaging devices 11 and 12, and a moving means 14 for minutely moving the imaging device 11 in a direction perpendicular to an optical axis 11a (see <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 6A</figref>) of the imaging device 11.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The two imaging devices 11 and 12 are, for example, a color CCD (hereinafter, also referred to as color CCD 11) having excellent color reproducibility and a monochrome CCD (hereinafter, also referred to as monochrome CCD 12) having higher sensitivity than the color CCD 11.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In a state in which the moving means 14, to be described later, is stopped, the color CCD 11 is disposed such that the optical axis 11a, which is perpendicular to its imaging surface, is aligned with the entrance optical axis X of the opening 10, which is provided in the connecting part 7. Furthermore, the monochrome CCD 12 has an optical axis 12a (see <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 6B</figref>) that is perpendicular to its imaging surface and that is located parallel to the optical axis 11a of the color CCD 11 with a gap interposed therebetween.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The imaging devices 11 and 12 are disposed in a sealed chamber (accommodating section) 16 that is fixed to an<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> intermediate plate 15 in the chassis 6. The sealed chamber 16 is provided with openings 16a and 16b at two positions, and the openings 16a and 16b are each sealed with a dust glass 17. Furthermore, a gap between the sealed chamber 16 and the intermediate plate 15 is sealed with a sealing member (not shown) so as to be air-sealed. Furthermore, a dehumidification means (not shown) for maintaining the sealed chamber 16 at low humidity may be provided in the sealed chamber 16.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Heat-transfer elements 18 for dissipating heat generated from the imaging devices 11 and 12 are disposed on back surfaces of the imaging devices 11 and 12. The heat-transfer elements 18 are, for example, Peltier elements, and are also used as structural members for fixing the imaging devices 11 and 12 to the moving means 14, to be described later.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The light-path switching means 13 includes a prism (light-path setting member) 19 and a swivel mechanism 20 that supports the prism 19 in a manner allowing it to swivel about a swivel axis 20a that is parallel to the optical axes 11a and 12a of the color CCD 11 and the monochrome CCD 12.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The prism 19 has a parallelepiped shape having two reflecting surfaces 19a and 19b disposed in parallel with a gap interposed therebetween.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The prism 19 is moved by the swivel mechanism 20 between a position on the entrance optical axis X of a light beam<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> entering from the opening 10 and a position shifted from the entrance optical axis X. When the reflecting surface 19a is disposed on the entrance optical axis X of a light beam entering from the opening 10, specifically, on the optical axis 11a of the color CCD 11, the optical axis 11a being aligned with the entrance optical axis X, the prism 19 is disposed at 45 degrees with respect to the optical axis 11a.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Thus, a light beam entering via the opening 10 is deflected by 90 degrees by the reflecting surface 19a and is then incident on the reflecting surface 19b.

Thus, an enlarged image of the specimen A formed by the objective lens 4, the imaging lens, and the eyepiece 5 can be observed.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">Then, to observe the image of the specimen A with the image acquisition apparatus 1, the light path is switched by a light-path switching mechanism (not shown) from the eyepiece 5 to the image acquisition apparatus 1 side. Thus, a light beam<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> from the specimen A enters the image acquisition apparatus 1 via the opening 10.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">To observe the specimen A with the color CCD 11 at low resolution, the computer connected to the connector 36 is operated to actuate the stepping motor 21 via the control section 23 to make the prism 19 swivel up to a position indicated by a solid line in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref> via the transfer mechanism 22. Because the prism 19 is thus removed from the light path between the opening 10 and the color CCD 11, a light beam entering the chassis 6 via the opening 10 is directly imaged by the color CCD 11 without passing through the prism 19.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">In this state, while keeping the movable part 33 stationary without actuating the moving means 14, the control section 23 activates the color CCD 11 to acquire an image of the specimen A. Thus, the image of the specimen A can be acquired with the number of pixels possessed by the color CCD 11.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">At this time, the color CCD 11 is cooled by driving the heat-transfer element 18. Heat generated in the heat-transfer element 18 is dissipated to the outside via the metal flat plate 29 constituting the moving means 14, the intermediate plate 15, and the chassis 6.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">Next, to observe the specimen A with the color CCD 11 at high resolution, the computer connected to the connector 36 is operated to actuate the moving means 14 via the control<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> section 23. With the moving means 14, the color CCD 11 disposed on the movable part 33 is displaced in a direction perpendicular to the optical axis 11a. The color CCD 11 is displaced by the moving means 14 by half the pixel pitch of the color CCD 11, for example, thereby making it possible to array pixels between the pixels of the color CCD 11 to configure a pseudo color CCD 11 in which a large number of pixels are arrayed with a short pixel pitch, thus acquiring a high-resolution image.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">Here, a similar resolution can also be obtained by actually employing a color CCD 11 in which a large number of pixels are arrayed with a short pitch; however, in that case, the level of light incident on each pixel is reduced, thus making it difficult to acquire a bright image. According to this embodiment, an advantage is afforded in that a high-resolution image can be acquired without reducing the image brightness.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">Furthermore, because only the dust glass 17 is disposed in the light path between the color CCD 11 and the opening 10, and substantially only air exists therein, there is another advantage that chromatic aberration is not caused, thus making it possible to acquire an image having high color-reproducibility.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">Furthermore, because the moving means 14 moves the color CCD 11 in a direction perpendicular to the optical axis, a<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> positional shift (decentering) of the image of the specimen A entering the color CCD 11 may be corrected.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">On the other hand, to observe the specimen A with the monochrome CCD 12 at high sensitivity, the computer is operated to actuate the stepping motor 21 via the control section 23 to make the prism 19 swivel up to a position indicated by a chain line in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref> via the transfer mechanism 22. Because the prism 19 is thus inserted between the opening 10 and the color CCD 11, a light beam entering the chassis 6 via the opening 10 is reflected by the two reflecting surfaces 19a and 19b of the prism 19 and is then imaged by the monochrome CCD 12.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">The monochrome CCD 12 is also cooled by driving the heat-transfer element 18.

Thus, even if the swivelling accuracy of the swivel mechanism 20 or the positioning accuracy of the prism 19 is low, a light beam entering from the opening 10 along the entrance optical axis X is reflected twice, enters the monochrome CCD 12 with accuracy along the optical axis 12a of the monochrome CCD 12, and is imaged by the monochrome CCD 12, without rotating the observed image.<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --></p><p id="p0061" num="0061">Furthermore, because the space in the chassis 6 where the optical systems are disposed is isolated by the intermediate plate 15 from the space where the stepping motor 21 and the transfer mechanism 22 are disposed, dust generated at the transfer mechanism 22 etc. does not obscure observation light. Therefore, a sharp image can be acquired by preventing dust from getting in the observed image. Furthermore, because the imaging devices 11 and 12 are disposed in the sealed chamber 16, entry of moisture-containing outside air is prevented, thus preventing the occurrence of condensation.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">In this way, according to the image acquisition apparatus 1 of this embodiment, in order to acquire high-resolution images, it is not necessary to adopt an imaging device with a small pixel pitch or a large-scale imaging device with a large number of pixels.
