This power unit 1 comprises an engine 2 which is coupled with an engine starter 3 and a set of alternators 4. The power unit 1 comprises also electrical equipments 8, which includes, for instance, the air conditioning, head<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> lights, inside lights and the radio. The engine starter 3, the set of alternators 4 and the electrical equipments 8 are connected to an electrical circuit 10.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The power unit 1 includes also an electrical energy storing system 12. This system 12 comprises an internal electrical circuit 14, which is connected to the electrical circuit 10 thanks to three contact terminals 13. A first controlled switch 16 is connected to the internal electrical circuit 14. For example, this controlled switch could be power transistors connected in parallel.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">A capacitor set 18 is connected to the controlled switch 16. This capacitor set could be composed of a plurality of capacitor set connected in series. Indeed, this kind of power sources can be charged quickly and can perform a very large number of charging and discharging cycles. Further more, ultracapacitors are capacitors able to reach capacities as high as 5000 F.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The electrical energy storing system 12 includes a second controlled switch 20 connected to the internal electrical circuit 14.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">A battery set 22 is connected to this second controlled switch 20, whose architecture could be the same as the first controlled switch 16. The battery set 22 is coupled to the internal electrical circuit 14 thanks to one of the contact terminal 13. On a motor bus, two batteries are often used.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> A control unit 24 is connected to both controlled switches 16, 20. This control unit 24 is an electronics device adapted at least to control the controlled switches 16, 20, according to the state of charge of the capacitor set 18. Further more, the control unit 24 is preferably adapted for receiving information from a central unit, not represented in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref>. Such information could be the state of the vehicle, that is to say, for instance, if it is in an accelerating or decelerating phase.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The implementation of the ultracapacitors increases the life time of the battery set 22 which is less stressed to do cycles. This implementation allows stopping the engine 2 when the vehicle is not moving, and to restart it when needed by using only the energy of the ultracapacitors and therefore by preserving the battery set 22. This has the consequence that a reduction of the battery size could be done.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Further more, the use of the ultracapacitor allows to start the engine 2 even if the battery set state of charge is too low for providing the requested current intensity. Indeed, it is possible to first charge the capacitor set with a low current from the battery set 22 and then use the energy of the capacitor set which are able to provide high current without being damaged.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">One of the main aspect of the present invention is that it is possible to charge the ultracapacitors when the vehicle is in<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> a decelerating phase and when the engine does not use fuel. This means that the capacitor charge is proceeded using free energy. This energy would be anyway lost.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">An example of a functioning algorithm of the power unit 1 is described here below. The functioning will be given with only the presence of the second controlled switch 20, that is to say without the first controlled switch 16.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">If the brake pedal of the motor vehicle is not activated and if the acceleration pedal is activated, the capacitor set 18 is charged with a current available from the alternator set 4 if the engine speed is greater than a minimum threshold value S1 and if the charge of the capacitor set 18 is lower than a threshold value C1. S1 represents the idling speed of the engine 2 and C1 is the maximum energy threshold value to which the capacitor set 18 can be charged. The C1 value is put between 60% and 90% of the maximal charge value of the capacitors, and preferably between 65% and 80%. Such a charge value will guarantee an increase of the capacitor life time. If the charge of the capacitor set 18 is greater than this threshold value C1, the current is put to zero. In this case, the controlled switch 20 is open. This means that no current contribution is given by the battery set 22. In other words, the gas oil consumption decreases.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">If the engine speed is lower than the threshold value S1 and if the capacitor set charge is greater than a threshold value<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> C2, the controlled switch 20 is open. C2 is a minimum energy threshold value under which the controlled switch 20 has to be closed. No contribution is given by the battery set 22. If its charge is lower than C2, the controlled switch is closed. This means that the battery set 22 is used to supply the electrical equipments 8.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">If the engine is considered to be stopped, that is to say that its speed is lower than a threshold value S2, and if the capacitor set charge is lower than a threshold value C3 necessary to start the engine 6, it is requested to start the engine 6 by using the battery set 22.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">If the capacitor set charge is greater than the threshold value C3, the capacitor set 18 takes the place of the alternator set 4. This means that there is no contribution from the alternators.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">It must be understood that when the vehicle is not moving, either the engine is stopped or not. If the engine 2 is stopped, the energy stored by the capacitor set 18 is used for powering the electrical equipments 8 and restarting the engine 2. If the engine is still running, the energy stored by the capacitor set 18 is used for powering the electrical equipments 8 instead of the alternator set 4. Therefore the mechanical load of the engine decreases, which has for consequence a decrease of the gas oil consumption.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0035" num="0035">If the acceleration pedal is not activated and if the engine speed is greater than the threshold value S1, the control unit 24 gives the command to charge the capacitor set 18 with a current contribution from the alternator set 4. The controlled switch 20 is open. The charge step of the capacitor set is done by using free energy.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">If the engine speed is greater than the threshold value S2, the capacitor set 18 is discharged if its charge is greater than C2, with the controlled switch 20 open. Otherwise, it is closed.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">If the engine speed is lower than S2 and if the capacitor set 18 is lower than C3, the engine has to be restarted with the battery set 22. On the contrary, if the capacitor set charge is greater than C3, the controlled switch 20 is open. The battery set 22 is not used. Otherwise, it is closed.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">If the brake pedal is activated and if the engine speed is greater than S1, the capacitor set 18 is charged and the controlled switch 20 is closed. In this case again, the energy used to charge the capacitor set is free.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">On the contrary, if the speed engine is lower than S1 but greater than S2, the ultracapacitors are discharged if their charge is greater than C2. The controlled switch 20 is open. If the charge is lower than C2, the controlled switch 20 is closed. The battery set is then used.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0040" num="0040">If the speed engine is lower than S2 and if the capacitor charge is greater than C2, the controlled switch 20 is open. Otherwise, it is closed.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">If the capacitor charge is lower than C3, it is requested to restart the engine 6. If the charge is greater than C2, the controlled switch 20 is open.

This L-shaped system can be used in a motor bus in association with two batteries 22<sub>1</sub>, 22<sub>2</sub>. The L-shaped system can comprise the capacitor set 18, the controlled switch 16, 20 and the control unit 24 in the same housing. As described<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> above, the batteries 22<sub>1</sub>, 22<sub>2</sub> are less stressed during the vehicle use by adding the electrical energy storing system 12. This enables to downsize the batteries. In term of weight and size, the association of the electrical energy storing system 12 and the batteries 22<sub>1</sub>, 22<sub>2</sub> is equivalent of the battery set of the state of the art. This means that retrofit could be easily done on motor bus equipped by the former battery set.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">While the invention has been shown and described with reference to certain embodiments thereof, it would be understood by those skilled in the art that changes in form and details may be therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the amended claims.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56983015" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Electrical energy storing system (12) for an engine vehicle (2) comprising a brake pedal, an accelerator pedal and an engine starter (3), an alternator (4) and electrical equipments (8) connected to an electrical circuit (10) of the vehicle, the electrical energy storing system (12) comprising at least:
