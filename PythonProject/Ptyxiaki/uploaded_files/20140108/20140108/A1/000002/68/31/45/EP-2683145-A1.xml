However, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that the present invention may be also applicable to a fixed terminal such as a digital TV and a desktop computer, except for specific configurations for mobility.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of a mobile terminal according to an example embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the mobile terminal 100 includes a wireless communication unit 110, an AN (AudioNideo) input unit 120, a user input unit 130, a sensing unit 140, an output unit 150, a memory 160, an interface unit 170, a controller 180, and a power supply unit 190. <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> shows the mobile terminal 100 having various components, but it is understood that implementing all of the illustrated components is not a requirement. The mobile terminal 100 may be implemented by greater or fewer components. Hereinafter, each of the above components will be explained.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The wireless communication unit 110 typically includes one or more components to authorize wireless or radio communication between the mobile terminal 100 and a radio communication unit system or a network in which the mobile terminal 100 is located. For example, the wireless communication unit 110 may include a broadcast receiving module 111, a mobile communication module 112, a wireless Internet module 113, a short range communication module 114, a position-location module 115, and the like.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The broadcast receiving module 111 receives broadcast signals and/or broadcast associated information from an external broadcast management server (or other network entity) via a broadcast channel. The broadcast channel may include a satellite channel and/or a terrestrial channel. The broadcast management server may be a server that generates and transmits a broadcast signal and/or broadcast associated information or a server that receives a previously generated broadcast signal and/or broadcast associated information and transmits the same to a terminal. The broadcast signal may include a TV broadcast signal, a radio broadcast signal, a data broadcast signal, and the like. Also, the broadcast signal may further include a broadcast signal<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> combined with a TV or radio broadcast signal.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The broadcast associated information may refer to information associated with a broadcast channel, a broadcast program or a broadcast service provider. The broadcast associated information may also be provided via a mobile communication network and received by the mobile communication module 112.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The broadcast associated information may exist in various forms. For example, it may exist in the form of an electronic program guide (EPG) of digital multimedia broadcasting (DMB), electronic service guide (ESG) of digital video broadcast-handheld (DVB-H), and the like.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The broadcast receiving module 111 may be configured to receive signals broadcast by using various types of broadcast systems. In particular, the broadcast receiving module 111 may receive a digital broadcast by using a digital broadcast system such as multimedia broadcasting-terrestrial (DMB-T), digital multimedia broadcasting-satellite (DMB-S), digital video broadcast-handheld (DVB-H), the data broadcasting system known as media forward link only (MediaFLO®), integrated services digital broadcast-terrestrial (ISDB-T) and the like. The broadcast receiving module 111 may be configured to be suitable for every broadcast system that provides a broadcast signal as well as the above-mentioned digital broadcast systems. Broadcast signals and/or broadcast-associated information received via the broadcast receiving module 111 may be stored in the memory 160.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The mobile communication module 112 transmits and/or receives radio signals to and/or from at least one of a base station, an external terminal and a server. Such radio signals may include a voice call signal, a video call signal or various types of data according to text and/or multimedia message transmission and/or reception.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The mobile communication module 112 is configured to implement a video call mode and a voice call mode. The video call mode indicates a call performed while a user views counterpart, whereas the voice call mode indicates a call performed while a user does not view counterpart. For implementation of the video call mode and the voice call mode, the mobile communication module 112 is configured to transmit and receive at least one of voice data and image data.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The wireless Internet module 113 supports wireless Internet access for the mobile terminal 100. This module may be internally or externally coupled to the mobile terminal 100. Here, as the wireless Internet<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> technique, a wireless local area network (WLAN), Wi-Fi, wireless broadband (WiBro), world interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX), high speed downlink packet access (HSDPA), and the like, may be used.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The short-range communication module 114 is a module for supporting short range communications. Some examples of short range communication technology include Bluetooth™, Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID), Infrared Data Association (IrDA), Ultra-WideBand (UWB), ZigBee™, and the like.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The position-location module 115 is a module for acquiring a location (or position) of the mobile terminal 100. For example, the position-location module 115 may include a GPS (Global Positioning System) module.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the AN input unit 120 is configured to receive an audio or video signal. The AN input unit 120 may include a camera 121 and a microphone 122. The camera 121 processes image data of still pictures or video acquired by an image capture device in a video capturing mode or an image capturing mode. The processed image frames may be displayed on a display unit 151.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The image frames processed by the camera 121 may be stored in the memory 160 or transmitted via the wireless communication unit 110. Two or more cameras 121 may be provided according to the configuration of the mobile terminal 100.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The microphone 122 may receive sounds (audible data) in a phone call mode, a recording mode, a voice recognition mode, and the like, and can process such sounds into audio data. The processed audio (voice) data may be converted for output into a format transmittable to a mobile communication base station via the mobile communication module 112 in case of the phone call mode. The microphone 122 may implement various types of noise canceling (or suppression) algorithms to cancel (or suppress) noise or interference generated in the course of receiving and transmitting audio signals.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The user input unit 130 may generate key input data from commands entered by a user to control various operations of the mobile terminal 100. The user input unit 130 allows the user to enter various types of information, and may include a keypad, a dome switch, a touch pad (e.g., a touch sensitive member that detects changes in resistance, pressure, capacitance, etc. due to being contacted) a jog wheel, a jog switch, and the like.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The sensing unit 140 detects a current status (or state) of the mobile terminal 100 such as an opened<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> or closed state of the mobile terminal 100, a location of the mobile terminal 100, the presence or absence of a user's touch (contact) with the mobile terminal 100 (e.g., touch inputs), the orientation of the mobile terminal 100, an acceleration or deceleration motion and direction of the mobile terminal 100, etc., and generates commands or signals for controlling the operation of the mobile terminal 100. For example, when the mobile terminal 100 is implemented as a slide type mobile phone, the sensing unit 140 may sense whether the slide phone is opened or closed.
