Here, in <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 8</figref>, sectional positions of a pair of cavities are mutually deviated in the rotational direction by 90 degrees. As illustrated in the drawing, a toroidal continuously variable transmission 1 includes a pair of input discs 2a, 2b being outer discs, an integrated output disc 3 being an inner disc, and a plurality of power rollers 4, 4. The pair of input discs 2a, 2b is rotatably connected as being synchronized in a mutually coaxial fashion via an input shaft 5 being a rotary shaft. Further, the output disc 3 is supported between both of the input discs 2a, 2b coaxially to both of the input discs 2a, 2b as being rotatable relatively to the both of the input discs 2a, 2b. Further, the power rollers 4, 4 are sandwiched by two or more respectively between axial-direction two-side surfaces of the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> output disc 3 and axial-direction one-side surfaces of both of the input discs 2a, 2b. Then, the respective power rollers 4, 4 transmit power from both of the input discs 2a, 2b to the output disc 3 while being rotated in accordance with rotation of both of the input discs 2a, 2b.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Both end portions (hereinafter, also called small end surfaces) in the axial direction of the output disc 3 are rotatably supported by a pair of ball bearings 6, 6 respectively being a thrust angular type. Accordingly, support posts 8a, 8b fixedly arranged at an inner surface of the casing 7 are connected by a circular retaining ring 9 which is a member fixed to the casing inner surface. The respective support posts 8a, 8b are for supporting support plates 11a, 11b which support both end portions of trunnions 10, 10 being support members to rotatably support the respective power rollers 4, 4 and are coaxially arranged to each other at the radially-opposite sides as sandwiching the input shaft 5. In this structure, a pair of the support posts 8a, 8b is connected by the retaining ring 9 and the input shaft 5 is inserted to the inside of the retaining ring 9.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Then, the ball bearings 6, 6 are arranged between the retaining rings 9, 9 which are arranged at the respective cavities and axial-direction two-end surfaces of the output disc 3, that is, portions being closer to the inner diameter side than output side surfaces 12, 12 arranged at the two-side<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> surfaces of the output disc 3. Short cylinder-shaped projecting stripe portions 14, 14 are formed over the entire peripheries at portions being close to the inner diameter side of outer surfaces (side faces being at mutually opposite sides) of a pair of thrust bearing rings 13a, 13b which structures the respective ball bearings 6, 6. Then, positioning of the respective ball bearings 6, 6 in the radial direction is performed by internally fitting the projecting strip portions 14, 14 to the retaining rings 9, 9 and the end portions of the output disc 3. Further, positioning of the respective ball bearings 6, 6 in the axial direction is performed by sandwiching shim plates 15, 15 respectively between one outer side surface of each of the thrust bearing rings 13a, 13a and the retaining rings 9, 9. Further, in this state, desired preliminary pressure is exerted to the ball bearings 6, 6.

Further, since a small end surface side of the inner disc is set to be a rolling surface, it is required to ensure end surface width at least by the amount of needle width. In accordance therewith, there may be a case that design change is required such that a disc size is to be enlarged or a shaft diameter is to be lessened. When the disc size is enlarged, weight is increased. Further, when the shaft diameter is lessened, allowable transmission torque is decreased. In addition, finishing area of a disc end surface is enlarged to cause increase of machining time and cost.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Meanwhile, in Patent Literature 2, a disc is supported by fitting thrust angular bearings to seal-case-like portions (inro-portions) which are arranged at small end surfaces of an integrated inner disc. In this case, thickness at the vicinity of the small end surface in the radial direction is lessened as a result of forming the seal-case-like portion, so that<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> stress occurring at this portion is increased when a smaller end surface is used as targeting to achieve range-widening. Accordingly, a use range of the disc is to be limited.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Further, in Patent Literature 3, a cylindrical portion is arranged at a small end surface and a bearing is arranged at the cylindrical portion to solve the problem of Patent Literature 2. However, it is required to be further elongated in the axial direction by the amount of arranging the cylindrical portion. In addition, machining becomes difficult.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In view of the above situation, it is an object of the present invention to provide a toroidal continuously variable transmission capable of reducing loss which occurs at a bearing and achieving range-widening at low cost with easy disc machinability.</p><heading id="h0007">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">In order to achieve the above object, the present invention provides a toroidal continuously variable transmission, including: a casing; a rotary shaft which is rotatably supported in the casing; a pair of outer discs which is supported at both end portions of the rotary shaft rotatably as being synchronized with the rotary shaft in a state that respective axial-direction one-side surfaces each having an arc-shaped section are mutually opposed; an inner disc which<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> is supported at a periphery of a middle portion of the rotary shaft as being rotatable relatively to the rotary shaft in a state that axial-direction two-side surfaces each having an arc-shaped section are opposed respectively to the axial-direction one-side surfaces of the outer discs; support members which are arranged by two or more respectively between the axial-direction two-side surface of the inner disc and the axial-direction one-side surface of each of the outer discs with respect to the axial direction as being swingable about pivot shafts located at twisted positions relatively to the rotary shaft; and power rollers which are rotatably supported respectively by the support members, each power roller including a peripheral surface as a spherically-shaped convex surface, as having the peripheral surface contacted to the axial-direction two-side surface of the inner disc and the axial-direction one-side surface of each of the outer discs, wherein a small end face of the inner disc is rotatably supported by ball bearings to a fixing member which is fixed to an inner surface of the casing, and a bearing ring of the ball bearing is formed at the small end surface of the inner disc and at least a part of the bearing ring is axially overlapped with a traction surface which is a boundary surface between the power roller and the inner disc.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">According to the above structure, since the ball bearing is adopted as a bearing, loss occurring at the bearing can be reduced compared to a thrust needle bearing. Further, since<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> a projected portion is not formed from the small end surface, disc machining is facilitated. Furthermore, since the bearing ring of the ball bearing is formed at the small end surface of the inner disc and at least a part of the bearing ring is axially overlapped with the traction surface which is the boundary surface between the power roller and the inner disc, range-widening can be achieved.</p><heading id="h0008">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading><p id="p0013" num="0013">According to the present invention, since a bearing ring of a ball bearing is formed at a small end surface of an inner disc and at least a part of the bearing ring is axially overlapped with a traction surface which is a boundary surface between a power roller and the inner disc, it is possible to provide a toroidal continuously variable transmission capable of reducing loss which occurs at the bearing and achieving range-widening at low cost with easy disc machinability.</p><heading id="h0009">Brief Description of Drawings</heading><p id="p0014" num="0014"><ul><li><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> is a sectional view of a main part of a toroidal continuously variable transmission according to a first embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2(a)</figref> is an enlarged view of a main part of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2(b)</figref> is an enlarged view of part Z in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2(a)</figref>.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is a sectional view illustrating a power roller<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> and a trunnion of the toroidal continuously variable transmission.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic view illustrating relation between the traction surface center of an inner disc and a tilt-roll shaft (a pivot shaft).</li><li><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 5</figref> is a sectional view illustrating a structure of the present invention (at a lower half) and a structure in the prior art (at an upper half) by comparison.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 6</figref> is a sectional view of a main part of a toroidal continuously variable transmission according to a second embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 7</figref> is a sectional view of a main part of a toroidal continuously variable transmission according to a third embodiment of the present invention.</li><li><figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 8</figref> is a sectional view of a toroidal continuously variable transmission including an integrated inner disc in the prior art.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0010">Description of Embodiments</heading><p id="p0015" num="0015">Hereinafter, the first embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Here, since features of the present invention relate to a support structure of an integrated inner disc and the rest of the structures and operations are similar to the structures and operations in the prior art as described above, only characteristic portions of the present invention will be<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> described in the following with brief description of the rest of portions while the same numerals as <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 8</figref> are provided thereto.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a section of a main part of a toroidal continuously variable transmission according to the embodiment of the present invention. Similarly to the toroidal continuously variable transmission 1 illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 8</figref>, the toroidal continuously variable transmission of the present embodiment is provided with a casing 7, an input shaft (a rotary shaft) 5 which is rotatably supported in the casing 7, a pair of input discs (outer discs) 2a, 2b which is supported at both end portions of the input shaft 5 rotatably as being synchronized with the input shaft 5 in a state that respective axial-direction one-side surfaces each having an arc-shaped section are mutually opposed, an output disc (an inner disc) 3 which is supported at a periphery of a middle portion of the input shaft 5 as being rotatable relatively to the rotary shaft 5 in a state that axial-direction two-side surfaces each having an arc-shaped section are opposed respectively to the axial-direction one-side surfaces of the input discs 2a, 2b, trunnions (support members) 10 which are arranged by two or more respectively between the axial-direction two-side surface of the output disc 3 and the axial-direction one-side surface of each of the input discs 2a, 2b with respect to the axial direction as being swingable about pivot shafts located at twisted positions relatively to the input shaft 5, and power rollers<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> 4 which are rotatably supported respectively by the trunnions 10, each power roller including a peripheral surface as a spherically-shaped convex surface, as having the peripheral surface contacted to the axial-direction two-side surface of the output disc 3 and the axial-direction one-side surface of each of the input discs 2a, 2b.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">As clearly illustrated especially in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, in the present embodiment, a bearing ring 100 for ball bearings 6 is arranged (directly formed) respectively at both small end surfaces 3a of the integrated output disc 3.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">That is, a groove-shaped raceway 101 in which balls of the ball bearings 6 roll is directly formed respectively at both small end surfaces 3a of the output disc 3.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Since the ball bearings 6 are adopted as bearings, loss occurring at the bearings 6 can be reduced compared to thrust needle bearings. Further, since it is only required to finish the bearing ring (the raceway surface) 100, machining area of the small end surface 3a can be reduced and cost can be reduced compared to a case of using thrust needle bearings. Here, the bearing 6 is not limited to thrust ball bearing, and may be thrust angular ball bearing. In the case of using thrust angular ball bearings, it is also possible to eliminate bearings to support the output disc 3 in the radial direction.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Further, since seal-case-like portions are not arranged in the present embodiment not like Patent Literature 2 described<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> above, thickness of the disc 3 at the vicinity of the small end portion 3a can be ensured so that the disc 3 can be used as being close to the small end portion 3a (that is, contact points of the power rollers 4 and the disc 3 can be shifted toward the small end surface 3a side). Accordingly, it is possible to achieve range-widening. In addition, in the present embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, owing to that a contact point (a contact oval) P between the power roller 4 and the disc 3 is axially overlapped with the bearing ring 100 which is arranged at the small end surface 3a by a predetermined amount L (owing to that at least a part of the bearing ring 100 is axially overlapped with a traction surface 12), range-widening can be further achieved. Further, since the bearing ring of the ball bearing 6 is not arranged separately, distance between the disc 3 and support posts 8a, 8b being fixing members can be further reduced. Owing to this effect, the small end surfaces 3a of the disc 3 can be further closed to the support posts 8a, 8b. Accordingly, since the traction surface (the boundary surface between the power roller 4 and the disc 3) can be widened, it is possible to contribute to achieve range-widening.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The range of the traction surfaces 12 at the surfaces of the output disc 3 opposed to the input discs 2a, 2b is the range of the surfaces to which the power rollers 4 can be contacted via lubrication oil (traction oil).

Therefore, the outer raceway 150 being a separate member from the output disc 3 enters between the output disc 3 and the raceway 101 for balls of the ball bearings 6, so that the traction surface 12 is narrowed.
