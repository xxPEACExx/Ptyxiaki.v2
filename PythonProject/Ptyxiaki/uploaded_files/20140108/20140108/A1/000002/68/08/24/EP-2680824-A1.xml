Firstly, gelatine is a material obtained from animals which results in a considerable variation of properties between different batches. Secondly, gelatine is in discussion as potential risk factor with regard to inducing bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), and, thirdly, gelatine has an off odours. Furthermore, gelatine is applied as coating in aqueous solution and the presence of water during the coating process and residual moisture in the film may affect stability of certain water sensitive drugs.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Sugar coating has been frequently used in the past but has also become less important due to its several drawbacks. Sugar coating can only be applied to tablets and requires several steps which are time consuming (I. Sealing/Water proofing to provide a moisture barrier and harden the tablet surface, II. Sub coating to cause a rapid buildup and round off the tablet edges, III. Several layering steps to smooth out the subcoated surface and to build up the sugar coat for the increase of the tablet size, IV. Colouring to give the tablet its colour and finished size, V. Smoothing and Polishing). This results in flattening of the tablet shape, disappearance of visibility of engravings and a thick coating, which is subject a higher risk of cracking. Further, sugar coating requires experienced personal, long process times and is difficult to automate.

 Film coating is currently the most frequently used coating method. </p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Generally, a mixture of polymers, pigments and excipients is dissolved in an appropriate organic solvent (for water insoluble polymers) or water (for water soluble polymers) to form a solution, or dispersed in water to form a dispersion, and then sprayed onto the dosage forms and dried by continuously providing heat, typically using hot air, until a dry coating film is formed. As organic based film-coating technology suffers toxicological, environmental, cost and safety-related disadvantages aqueous-based coating technology is usually preferred and was developed to phase out organic based coating using water as solvent. </p><p id="p0007" num="0007"> However, aqueous-based coating is associated with other problems such as a slow drying rate of coating, high energy input to remove water, microbial contamination, etc.. Furthermore, the presence of water during the coating process and residual moisture in the film may affect stability of certain water sensitive drugs. </p><p id="p0008" num="0008"> As a result both kinds of film coating, the organic and the aqueous film coating techniques involve problems, which are principally associated with solvent used to dissolve or disperse the coating materials. Therefore, a coating process, which does not use an organic solvent or water, seems to be desirable. </p><p id="p0009" num="0009"> Powder coating is an approach to overcome the problems involved with solvents. US 6,117,479 A describes a process of powder coating. In such process electrostatically charged powders are applied to tablets that are fixed in a holder that flips them to expose both sides to the coating. The powder, which adheres to the tablets due to the electrostatic difference, is then fused by applying heat energy (infrared radiation). As the high temperatures necessary to fuse the powder to a coating are detrimental for the active ingredient plasticizers have been added to the coating material to reduce the softening temperature (T<sub>s</sub>) or glass transition temperature (T<sub>g</sub>) to achieve a feasible operation temperature. However, in order to achieve 
<!-- EPO <DP n="4"/>-->
 sufficient coating thickness excessive amount of plasticizers have been found to be necessary, which disadvantageously leads to very soft and sticky films. </p><p id="p0010" num="0010"> WO 2007/014464 A1 discloses that separation of coating step into two steps, where the plasticizer is applied to the tablet in a first step and the further coating material is applied in a subsequent step, lead to some improvement in this respect but does not solve such problem at all. </p><p id="p0011" num="0011"> In general tablets or pellets coated by a powder coating process require higher coating levels/thicker coating layers to obtain similar functional properties (e.g. moisture/oxygen protection or drug release patterns). </p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Powder coating techniques potentially suffer from problems such as the use of high amounts of plasticizers (e.g. Talcum), the need of additional excipients and problems regarding uniformity of film formation dependent on time effective curing processes and ageing problems during storage. Reduction of pinholes and a homogeneous film formation are dependent on the glass transition of the polymers and therefore strongly dependent on process temperature and temperature/humidity conditions during storage. For example products coated with ethylcellulose, which is used very commonly, often exhibits storage problems, especially at climatic zone 4 or 4b, due to its relatively low glass transition temperature (T<sub>g</sub>) of about 50/60°C. </p><p id="p0013" num="0013"> The known methods used for coating solid pharmaceutical preparations are associated with several disadvantages as set forth above. Powder coating seems to have some advantages but such technology is rarely used and requires further development. It would be desirable to provide coated pharmaceutical formulations, which don't suffer the problems of the coated formulations of the state-of-the-art as set forth above. In addition, the coated formulations should have a homogeneous pinhole free uniform coating protecting the coated article from external disturbances such as moisture and oxygen and should avoid large layer thicknesses.

 The present invention provides coated solid pharmaceutical </p><p id="p0014" num="0014">preparations, which have an ultrathin, conformal coating on the surface thereof. By "ultrathin", it is meant that the thickness of the coating is up to about 100 nm. By "conformal" it is meant that the thickness of the coating is relatively uniform across the surface of the pharmaceutical preparation, so that the surface shape of the coated pharmaceutical preparation closely resembles that of the uncoated pharmaceutical preparation. </p><p id="p0015" num="0015"> Pharmaceutical preparation above and below is taken to mean a term for various technical administration forms as are known for the administration of medicaments to humans or animals. The expression pharmaceutical preparation is thus independent of a particular legal status and is in no way restricted to medicaments, ingredients which may be present are various substances, such as, for example, medicaments, food supplements and/or functional ingredients. Examples of pharmaceutical preparation for the purposes of the present invention can be in the form of medicaments and food supplements. </p><p id="p0016" num="0016"> According to a preferred embodiment of the invention the coated solid pharmaceutical preparation has a thickness from about 0.1 to about 100 nm, more preferably from about 0.3 to about 50 nm, even more preferably from about 0.5 to about 35 nm and most preferably from about 1 and about</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">10 nm. </p><p id="p0018" num="0018"> Solid pharmaceutical preparations which are suitable to be converted into the coated solid pharmaceutical preparation include all kinds of solid pharmaceutical preparations such as pellets, granules, tablets or capsules. Accordingly, a preferred embodiment of the invention is characterized in that the solid pharmaceutical preparation is a pellet, a granule, a tablet or a capsule. </p><p id="p0019" num="0019"> A suitable and preferred method for providing such coated </p><p id="p0020" num="0020">pharmaceutical preparations is applying the coating material through atomic layer controlled growth techniques.

In these techniques, the coating is formed in a series of two or more self-limited reactions, which in most instances can be repeated to sequentially deposit additional layers of the coating material until a desired coating thickness is achieved. </p><p id="p0024" num="0024"> According to a preferred embodiment of the invention the coating of the coated solid pharmaceutical preparation has been applied at process temperatures from about 40°C to about 300°C, more preferably from about 40°C to about 200°C, even more preferably from about 40°C to about 150°C and most preferably from about 50°C to 100°C. </p><p id="p0025" num="0025"> In most instances, the first of these reactions will involve some functional group on the surface of the pharmaceutical preparation, such as a Z-O-H or Z-N-H group, where Z represents an atom such as a carbon. The individual reactions are advantageously carried out separately and under conditions such that all excess reagents and reaction products are removed before conducting the succeeding reaction. </p><p id="p0026" num="0026"> It is preferred to treat the pharmaceutical preparation before initiating the reaction sequence to remove volatile materials that may be absorbed onto

Also, in some instances a precursor reaction may be done to introduce desirable functional groups onto the surface of the pharmaceutical formulation. </p><p id="p0027" num="0027"> In principle all kinds of coatings such as oxide coating, nitride coating or sulfide coating can be applied to the solid pharmaceutical preparation. As pharmaceutical preparations are dedicated to be applied to animals or humans toxicological considerations have to be taken into account in the selection of the coating. From this point of view oxide coatings, especially metal oxide coatings as described hereinafter, are preferred. Accordingly, one preferred embodiment of the invention is directed to a coated solid pharmaceutical preparation, wherein the coating comprises one or more metal oxides. </p><p id="p0028" num="0028"> In one embodiment of the invention each layer of coating is composed of one metal oxide.

Mixtures of different metal oxides in one layer can be used to modify the properties of the layer and to adapt it to the specific demands. Accordingly, another preferred embodiment of the invention is directed to a coated solid pharmaceutical preparation, wherein the coating comprises one or more layers, wherein each layer essentially consists of a mixture of two or more metal oxides. </p><p id="p0030" num="0030"> In principle, if the coating comprises more than one layer each of such layers can be composed of a different metal oxide and/or mixtures of two or more metal oxides.

 The invention is also directed to a method for producing the coated solid pharmaceutical preparation as described herein, characterized in that the following steps are conducted (a) introducing into a reactor pre-filled with the solid pharmaceutical preparation to be coated a first precursor, which is in a gaseous state, (b) purging and/or evacuating the reactor to remove the non-reacted precursors and the gaseous reaction by-products (c) exposing of the second precursor - to activate the surface again for the reaction of the first precursor (d) purging and/or evacuating of the reactor and optionally repeating the steps (a) to (d) in order to achieve the desired coating thickness. </p><p id="p0052" num="0052"> A convenient method for applying the ultrathin, conformal coating to the base is to form a fluidized bed of the solid pharmaceutical preparations, and then pass the various reagents in turn through the fluidized bed under reaction conditions. Methods of fluidizing solid pharmaceutical preparations are well known, and generally include supporting the solid pharmaceutical preparations on a porous plate or screen. A fluidizing gas is passed upwardly through the plate or screen, lifting the solid pharmaceutical preparations somewhat and expanding the volume of the bed. With appropriate expansion, the solid pharmaceutical preparations behave much as a fluid. Fluid (gaseous or liquid) reagents can be introduced into the bed for reaction with the surface of the solid pharmaceutical preparations. </p><p id="p0053" num="0053"> In this invention, the fluidizing gas also can act as an inert purge gas for removing unreacted reagents and volatile or gaseous reaction products. In addition, the reactions can be conducted in a rotating cylindrical vessel or a rotating tube. </p><p id="p0054" num="0054"> If desired, multiple layers of ultrathin coatings can be deposited on the solid pharmaceutical preparations. This method is of specific interest where, due to the chemical nature of the base solid pharmaceutical preparation, the desired coating cannot easily be applied directly to the particle surface. In such cases, an intermediate ultrathin layer can be

 applied to provide a surface to which the desired outer layer can be applied more easily. </p><p id="p0055" num="0055"> Another advantage is that the invention will minimize the level of coating material used, as compared to existing film coating techniques. The invention only requires a very thin layer, thereby needing only a minimum amount of material for the coating to be effective against water and oxygen penetration. Minimizing of the amount of coating material is especially desired if a coating material is used, which shouldn't be taken in in large quantities, such as aluminium oxide. Furthermore, if such materials are used the quantity of them can be further reduced by mixing the them with other metal oxides, such as titanium oxide. </p><p id="p0056" num="0056"> Coating of vitamin c tablets with Ti0<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>0<sub>3</sub> and a mixture of Ti0<sub>2</sub>+AI<sub>2</sub>03 shows significant variation in the solubility rates, where pure Al<sub>2</sub>0<sub>3</sub> coated tablet has the fastest solubility rate and Ti0<sub>2</sub> the lowest.

 As clearly shown by table 4, ALD coating leads to significantly decreased peroxide values. Further, the iodine and anisidine values for the ALD coated capsules are at least as good as the capsules without ALD coating. Therefore overall stability of fish oil capsules is significantly increased by ALD coating.
