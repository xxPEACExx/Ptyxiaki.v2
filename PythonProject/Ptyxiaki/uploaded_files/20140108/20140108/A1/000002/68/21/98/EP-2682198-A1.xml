in the specific case, the proportional<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> direction valve 6, V8 has three possible positions between which the slider can move, affecting them both partially and completely.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">There is a first inactive position with closed centers, in which there is no connection between the various branches P (pressurized branch), T (discharge), A (use) and B (use) which arrive at/exit from the proportional direction valve 6, V8, which behaves like a plug, preventing the passage of the oil in any direction.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">There is a second position, designated by V8A, with crossed centers, in which the branch P is connected to the branch B; in this condition the oil flows toward the cambering jacks 7 of the lower beam 3; the branch T is also connected to the branch A; in this condition, since A is plugged, nothing happens.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">There is a third position, designated by V8B, with straight centers: the branch P is thus connected to the branch A (and since A is plugged, nothing happens) and the branch T is connected to the branch B: in this case the oil that arrives from the cambering jacks 7 is discharged.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The pump 4, P1 is activated at power-on of the machine or press: in this step a motor 8, M is switched on which, by rotating the pump 4, P1, starts to make the oil circulate in the circuit.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The oil flows through a first valve 9, V5, which is a one-way valve for protecting the pump 4, P1; it is a one-way valve that prevents the flow of the oil toward the pump 4, P1 whereas it allows its flow toward the user device.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In this condition, the circuit is not pressurized, because the fluid is discharged through a first electric valve 10, V1 that is in the inactive position.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The first electric valve 10, V1 in the inactive position discharges the circuit onto the tank 11, whereas in the position V1A it prevents the passage of the oil toward the tank 11, i.e., it acts as a plug.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In order to pressurize the circuit, all the drains to the tank 11 must be<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> closed, and therefore the first electric valve 10, V1 is energized and reaches the position V1A and, if there is a safety block 12 for accumulators 5, ACC, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref>, a second electric valve 13, V2 also is energized which in turn reaches the position V2A.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The proportional direction valve 6, V8 is in the inactive position with the centers closed, i.e., with P, T, A and B plugged; the oil cannot pass through it and therefore the part of the circuit that is upstream thereof is pressurized.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In the configuration of the preceding case, one achieves also the loading of the accumulator 5, ACC, since the first valve 9, V5 and a second valve 14, V5 and a third electric valve 15, V3, the first two being simple one-way valves and the last one being a one-way valve in the inactive position, prevent the flow of the oil only downward; therefore, once the circuit is pressurized the accumulator 5, ACC begins to load.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">When a pressure transducer 16, T1 sends the signal that the reference pressure (target) has been reached, the first electric valve 10, V1 is deactivated and the oil resumes flowing through it from the pump 4, P to the tank 11.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Due to the configuration of the third electric valve 15, V3, which is inactive, the accumulator 5, ACC remains pressurized.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Once the preparatory step for the power-on of the machine or press has ended, the bending cycle can begin; initially there is a quick descent of the upper beam 2 and then the step of approach to the metal plate to be bent (not shown) at the working speed begins.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Shortly before the metal plate to be bent interacts with the lower beam 3, the pump 4, P1 is inserted in the circuit again by activation of the first electric valve 10, V1, moving it to the position V1A.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">One reaches a situation of equilibrium as regards the pressures, between the branches upstream and downstream of the third electric valve 15, V3, which therefore can be in the position V3A so that the oil of the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> accumulator 5, ACC can flow in the circuit; as long as this situation of pressure balance persists, nothing happens.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Upstream of the proportional direction valve 6, V8, which continues to remain inactive, the circuit is pressurized and the accumulator 5, ACC is inserted.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The bending step begins and therefore following, deformation and cambering in position occur.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The main cylinders 17a, 17b of the press push downward in order to reach the levels YY1 and YY2 that will allow reaching the target angle of the plate being bent.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">As this step proceeds, the upper beam 2 is deformed; the numeric control or computer 18, CNC begins comparing the values of the deformation of the upper beam 2 with those of the lower beam 3, measured respectively by adapted position transducers 19, UT and 20, LT, and operates accordingly; its purpose is to render the deflection of the lower beam 3 equal to the deflection of the upper beam 2.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">To achieve this, the cambering jacks 17a, 17b must be opened more or less according to need; the 'more or less' is obtained by operating on the proportional direction valve 6, V8, moving its slider continuously and proportionally to the supply current of the coils between the positions V8A and V8B.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">By moving toward the position V8A, the oil flows toward the cambering jacks 17a, 17b, pressurizing them and opening them.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">By moving toward the position V8B, the cambering is depressurized and consequently the deformation of the lower central beam 3 is reduced.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The numeric control or computer 18, CNC operates therefore in the following manner: if the level QUT detected by the transducer 19, UT on the upper beam 2 is higher than the level QLT detected by the transducer 20, LT on the lower beam 3, the slider of the proportional direction valve 6, V8 is induced to move toward the position V8A and the deformation of the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> lower beam 3 is increased.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">If instead QUT&lt;QLT, the slider of the proportional direction valve 6, V8 is caused to move toward the position V8B and the deformation of the lower beam 3 is decreased.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">If QUT = QLT, the slider of the proportional direction valve 6, V8 is caused to move toward the inactive position and the deformation of the lower beam 3 is kept constant.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">All this occurs in a continuous and dynamic manner; as the two deflections mutually approach, the proportional direction valve 6, V8 approaches the central closure position; as the demand for oil decreases, the excess oil reloads the accumulator 5, ACC.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Once the main cylinders 17a, 17b of the machine or press have reached the target levels YY1 and YY2 and the values of the deflections of the two beams, the lower one 3 and the upper one 2, are identical, this means that the part has been bent, and therefore the relaxation step begins, in which the pressure in the main cylinders 17a, 17b is decreased and the structure relaxes.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The upper beam 2 returns to the horizontal and therefore, since cambering is still active, the lower beam 3, which continues to follow its deflection, also returns to the horizontal, discharging the excess oil from the cambering jacks 7.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Once the relaxation step has finished, with the upper beam 2 and the lower beam 3 by now perfectly horizontal, the proportional direction valve 6, V8 is returned to the inactive position and one is ready to restart with a new bending cycle by reloading the accumulators 5, ACC if necessary.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">It is noted that in circuits with accumulators 5, ACC of a capacity greater than one liter, and therefore with a safety block 12 certified according to the mandatory standards of the country of destination, once the machine or press has been powered on, the second electric valve 13, V2 remains always active (discharge closed) so that the oil cannot be<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> discharged into the tank 11;
