Authentication systems that conduct network-based authentication transactions based on voice biometric data typically require users to recite a phrase which is used to verify the identity of the user. Such authentication systems have been known to prompt all individuals to recite the same phrase. However, imposters have been known to surreptitiously obtain voice biometric data of users and to impersonate users during remotely conducted network-based biometric authentication transactions by providing a false claim of identity supported by fraudulent biometric data in an effort to deceive an authenticating entity into concluding that the imposter is the person they claim to be. Such impersonations are known as spoofing.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Impostors currently use many methods to obtain or create fraudulent biometric data of others that can be submitted during authentication transactions. For voice biometric data imposters have been known to eavesdrop on networks during legitimate network-based biometric authentication transactions to surreptitiously obtain genuine voice biometric data of users reciting the requested phrase. The imposters then use the obtained biometric data for playback during fraudulent network-based authentication transactions. Such fraudulent biometric data are known to be difficult to detect using known liveness detection methods. Verifying that the biometric data presented during a network-based authentication transaction conducted at a remote location is from a live person at the remote location, is known as liveness detection or anti-spoofing.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Methods of liveness detection have been known to use text independent voice recognition techniques in an effort to prevent imposters from conducting fraudulent transactions with surreptitiously obtained voice biometric data. However, authentication systems that authenticate based on text independent voice recognition techniques frequently<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> generate inaccurate results and thus have unacceptably low biometric authentication accuracy rates of performance.</p><heading id="h0002">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">In one aspect, a method for improving the accuracy performance of authentication systems includes determining an authentication data requirement for a desired transaction and at least one new verification phrase. The method also includes capturing authentication data from a user with a communications device in accordance with the authentication data requirement, and capturing biometric data of the at least one new verification phrase from the user with the communications device. Moreover, the method includes adding the determined at least one new verification phrase to an enrollment phrase registry and storing the biometric data captured for the at least one new verification phrase in an enrollment data record of the user after successfully authenticating the user.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In another aspect, a computer system for improving the accuracy of authentication transaction results includes a service provider system engaged in controlling access to resources. The service provider system contains a database and is configured to conduct transactions regarding the resources. Moreover, the system includes a communications device configured to communicate with the service provider system over a network and to capture biometric data. The computer system also includes an authentication system including an authentication database.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The authentication system is configured to communicate with the service provider system and the communications device over the network. Moreover, the authentication system is configured to store enrollment data records and an enrollment phrase registry, determine the liveness of users communicating a desire to conduct a network-based transaction with the service provider system, and to determine at least one new verification phrase for the network-based transaction. Furthermore, the authentication system is configured to add the determined at least one new verification phrase to the enrollment phrase registry, and store biometric data captured for the at least one new verification phrase in the enrollment data record of the user.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In yet another aspect, a computer program recorded on a non-transitory computer-readable recording medium is provided.

Furthermore, the device 12 may process the captured biometric data prior to transmitting it to the BAC system 16. For example, the device 12 may capture biometric data, create a biometric template from the captured data, and then transmit the biometric template to the BAC system 16. Although the AEAC system 10 includes one device 12, the AEAC system 10 may alternatively include any number of devices 12 that are each associated with a same or different user.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The SPC system 14 is a computer system that stores and controls access to resources and conducts transactions regarding the resources. Resources include any kind of data that is protected against access by unauthorized users. Such resources include, but are not limited to, electronic artifacts, services and applications.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">As described herein the SPC system 14 is associated with a financial institution. Thus, the SPC system 14 is configured to store and control access to at least the financial accounts for each of a plurality of financial institution customers, and facilitates conducting transactions involving the financial accounts. Moreover the SPC system 14 is configured to communicate with the device 12, the BAC system 16, other systems (not shown), and other devices (not shown) over the network 22. Although the SPC system 14 is associated with a financial institution the SPC system 14 is in no way limited to being associated with a financial institution. Alternatively, the SPC system 14 may be associated with any type of business or entity such as a merchant that sells merchandise from its web site over the network 22. The SPC system 14 may also function to implement a virtual private network for any type of business or entity that protects access to resources such as, but not limited to, electronic files, electronic documents, and electronic media. Electronic media includes, but is not limited to, movies. Although the AEAC system 10 includes one SPC system 14 associated with a financial institution, the AEAC system 10 may alternatively include a plurality of SPC systems 14 that are each associated with a different business or entity.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The BAC system 16 includes components such as, but not limited to, a web server, a database server, an application server, a directory server and a disk storage unit that may be used to store any kind of data. The disk storage unit may store at least one database such as, but not limited to, an authentication database. The application server stores applications therein that cause the BAC system 16 to perform the functions described herein. The BAC system 16 also includes a database management server and an authentication server. The database management server may be used to facilitate transferring data to and from the disk storage device. The authentication server performs matching of any feature or information associated with users to authenticate the identity of users during authentication transactions as described herein. The BAC system 16 is also configured to communicate with the device 12, the SPC system 14, other systems (not shown), and devices (not shown) over the network 22.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The authentication database stores at least authentication data of each of a plurality of users in enrollment data records. The authentication data may be any kind of information that may be used to authenticate users such as, but not limited to, biometric data, Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates, and pass-phrases, and any combination of biometric data, GPS coordinates, and pass-phrases. Biometric data may correspond to any biometric characteristic desired to be used as the basis of authenticating a user. Such biometric characteristics include, but are not limited to, voice, face, finger, iris, palm, and electrocardiogram, and any combination of voice, face, finger, iris, palm, and electrocardiogram. The biometric data may take any form such as, but not limited to, audio recordings and photographic images.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The enrollment data record of each authorized user stored in the BAC system 16 includes data such as, but not limited to, enrollment biometric data, enrollment biometric templates, and personal data. Enrollment biometric data is raw biometric data obtained from the user during enrollment in the BAC system 16. The enrollment biometric data for each user is processed during enrollment to generate at least one enrollment biometric template, for each respective user, which is used by the BAC system 16 to conduct authentication transactions. Biometric data captured from users during authentication transactions may also be stored in the enrollment data record of the user. Moreover, biometric data captured during authentication transactions may be processed into biometric template data, included in the enrollment data record of the user, and used to conduct authentication transactions. Personal data includes any demographic information regarding an individual including, but not limited to, an individual's name, age, date-of-birth, address, citizenship and marital status. Each enrollment data record may also include any kind of data that may be used to authenticate the identity of users as described herein.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Although biometric data is captured from each user during enrollment in the BAC system 16, biometric data may alternatively be obtained by other methods such as, but not limited to, automatically reading or extracting the biometric data from identity documents or from legacy databases included in other computer systems. Likewise, biometric templates corresponding to the biometric data may be obtained by other methods such as, but not limited to, automatically reading or extracting the biometric templates from identity documents or from legacy databases included in other computer systems. Templates corresponding to desired biometric data may be obtained in addition to, or instead of, the desired biometric data<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> itself. Such other legacy database systems include, but are not limited to, systems associated with motor vehicle administrations, social security administrations, welfare system administrations, financial institutions and health care providers. Such identity documents include, but are not limited to, passports and driver's licenses. By extracting desired biometric data or biometric templates from a legacy database or identity document, and storing the extracted data in the BAC system 16, users may be enrolled therein without having to directly provide biometric data.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The BAC system 16 may also store configurable authentication policies, some of which may be used to determine data that is to be captured or obtained from users during enrollment in the BAC system 16, and others which may be used to determine an authentication data requirement. The authentication data requirement is the authentication data desired to be captured from users during authentication transactions. Such authentication policies may determine the authentication data requirement based on factors such as, but not limited to, the risk associated with a desired network-based transaction. The BAC system 16 may determine the authentication data requirement by randomly selecting the authentication data requirement from such authentication policies. Moreover, the BAC system 16 may determine the authentication data requirement by executing algorithms. For example, the BAC system 16 may execute an algorithm which determines a least recently used authentication data requirement as the authentication data requirement for an authentication transaction. The BAC system 16 may determine the authentication data requirement in any manner.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The device 12, the SPC system 14, and the BAC system 16, respectively, each include a processor (not shown) and a memory (not shown).

More specifically, the phrase registry 24 includes phrases 24-1 to 24-8 that are recited by users during enrollment in the BAC system 16, which recitations are stored as enrollment biometric data in the enrollment data records of the respective users. Thus, the phrases 24-1 to 24-8 are used to facilitate generating and storing voice biometric data of each user in the BAC system 16 that can be used for conducting text-dependent authentication transactions. Because text-dependent authentication techniques are inherently more accurate than text-independent authentication techniques, reciting any one of, or any combination of, the phrases 24-1 to 24-8 during an authentication transaction facilitates increasing the accuracy of voice biometric data authentication results.

The BAC system 16 determines which phrases from the enrollment phrase registry 24 are to be the authentication data requirement and thus included in the registry 26. The authentication data requirement for each authentication transaction is different. Consequently, the phrases included in the registry 26 are different for each authentication transaction. Although the verification phrase registry 26 includes three phrases, the phrase registry 26 may alternatively include any number of phrases from the enrollment phrase registry 24. It should be appreciated that only enrollment phrases included in the enrollment phrase registry 24, that have corresponding biometric data stored in the enrollment data record of a user, may be included in the verification phrase registry 26.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Because the enrollment phrase is different for each authentication transaction, the biometric data to be captured is not known in advance to an imposter and thus appears unpredictable. Consequently, due to the number of different combinations of enrollment phrases that may be determined by the BAC system 16, the determined enrollment phrases constitute an unpredictable condition injected into biometric authentication transactions by the BAC system 16 that facilitate making it more difficult for imposters to successfully spoof the BAC system 16. An unpredictable condition is a condition required for successful authentication that an imposter cannot effectively accurately anticipate.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 4</figref> is a diagram illustrating an exemplary new verification phrase registry 28 including new verification phrases 28-1 and 28-2, not included in the enrollment phrase registry 24 that may be recited by a user before, during, or after an authentication transaction.

The authentication data requirement is the verification phrases 24-1, 24-7, and 24-8. Next, the BAC system 16 continues by generating a data capture request message that includes the authentication data requirement, and transmitting the data capture request message to the device 12. The BAC system 16 may also determine a new verification phrase to include in the data capture request message. The device 12 continues processing by displaying the authentication data requirement for the user to see. After reading the authentication data requirement, the user continues by capturing authentication data 40 from his self with the device 12 in accordance with the authentication data requirement.

Alternatively, the user may manually control transmission of the captured authentication data by operating a button 18 of the device 12. When biometric data corresponding to a new verification phrase is captured, the new verification phrase biometric data is also transmitted to the BAC system 16 with the captured authentication data. After receiving the captured data, the BAC system 16 continues processing by authenticating the user 42. More specifically, the BAC system 16 determines whether the captured authentication data matches the stored authentication data of the user. When the captured authentication data does not match the stored authentication data of the user, processing continues by transmitting a message 44 to the device 12 notifying the user that because of the unsuccessful authentication the desired network-based transaction cannot be conducted.
