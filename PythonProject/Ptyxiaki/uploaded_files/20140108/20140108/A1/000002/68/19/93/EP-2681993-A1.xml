Vapormate® requires a boiling point of &gt;55 °C to vaporise the product. This quality is unique to this fumigant mixture (approx 12-17% v/v ethyl formate in carbon dioxide, preferably around 16.5-16.7%) meaning conventional vaporisers without temperature control provide inconsistent results.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Although the invention will be described hereinafter with reference to this application, it will be appreciated that it is not limited to this particular field of use.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of the common general knowledge in the field.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Information contained in this patent specification may be cross-referenced against the Applicant's document: <i>Vapormate</i>® <i>Portable Electric Vaporiser,</i> available to customers from BOC Australia, from mid-July 2012 (i.e., after this provisional patent application is filed). The content of this BOC document is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Methyl bromide ("MeBr") has been in use for many years as a general fumigant. In Australia, methyl bromide is the preferred fumigant required by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) for most organic goods imported into Australia. However, methyl bromide is a known ozone-depleting chemical and has been banned throughout Europe following ratification of the Montreal Protocol.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Notwithstanding, when used industrially, methyl bromide is relatively simple to vaporise; its boiling point is around 3½ °C. Due to the relatively low energy input required for vaporising methyl bromide, the equipment used is generally unsophisticated. It is typically heated within a water bath heat exchanger. The typical format is a copper heat exchanger coil submerged in a water bath heated by an LPG burner. Typically, there are no control systems or overload devices installed. The only limitation of the control is the boiling point<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> of water itself. Such systems are not gas tight, so superheated steam cannot be generated.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The equipment used to vaporise methyl bromide tends to be either open to atmosphere or have an enclosed but unsealed unit which is not gas/leak tight. Insulation (if any) is generally basic and primitive. As the equipment is not sealed, there is no need for a pressure relief device, however, there are numerous disadvantages inherent in such systems:
<ul><li>● Water evaporates and has to be replenished on a regular basis</li><li>● The unit needs to be filled onsite, prior to use</li><li>● Operation site needs a water supply</li><li>● Loss of heat through water surface results in long warm-up times</li><li>● Requires LPG source to be transported with equipment</li><li>● Needs to be emptied for transport and re-filled before re-use.</li></ul></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Other widely-used fumigants include: phosphine, 1,3-dichloropropene, chloropicrin, methyl isocyanate, hydrogen cyanide, sulfuryl fluoride, formaldehyde and iodoform.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Vapormate® is the Applicant's proprietary formulation comprising ethyl formate (c.12-17%) in liquefied carbon dioxide. Vapormate® is intended to be a reliable, eco-friendly alternative to methyl bromide. It has no known insect resistance, low human toxicity and significantly less "withholding period" (<i>i.e</i>., hours, <i>cf.</i> days/weeks), which means that its residues quickly break down to levels occurring naturally in food and in the environment.

Ethyl formate has a boiling point of 54 °C, whereas carbon dioxide has a boiling point of approximately -78 °C when stored at typical pressures (e.g., 50 to 70 bar).<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The appreciably different physical properties of carbon dioxide and ethyl formate are highlighted with respect to the table, above.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">For Vapormate®, the boiling point is considered to be 55 °C. This is the minimum temperature that needs to be maintained to ensure that all the ethyl formate is vaporised and the product is delivered as a gas with no liquid droplets. In practice the temperature needs to be significantly higher than this to ensure that the vaporised product retains enough heat to maintain its vapour phase as it is piped from the vaporiser to the point of application.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The vaporising equipment described above was generally developed for bulk fumigation of large areas - typically, shipping containers, fumigation chambers and fumigation tents. On the other hand, the early development of Vapormate® was typically limited to dosing small volumes of gas into approximate 20 L bags of fruit or other produce. Such devices mixed Vapormate® with air to pre-dilute the gas before application. However, applying Vapormate® directly to produce at close range is limited by the fact that the two components have different specific heat capacities and different rates of expansion. This can result in high concentrations of ethyl formate coming into contact with the produce, causing phytotoxic damage; this occurs because the ethyl formate does not have the chance to expand and distribute evenly throughout the bag, resulting in ethyl formate-rich and carbon dioxide-rich regions.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Several iterations of Vapormate® vaporisers have been developed, with varying degrees of success. The early models were generally designed to deliver short bursts of gas over a period of 10 to 20 seconds. This approach can be problematic due to the way Vapormate® is released from the cylinder. As the mixture exits through the valve it is expanding and cooling due to the Joule-Thomson effect; the valve effectively acts as a nozzle. As mentioned above, the two components have different specific heat capacities and different rates of expansion. When extracted in short bursts, the general proportion of ethyl formate (c. 12-17%) in carbon dioxide can be difficult to maintain. This typically results in gas streams rich in either component. This, in turn, impacts dosing and fumigation control. The effect is much less significant when large volumes are extracted over a period of time, ensuring that a level of equilibrium is maintained within acceptable tolerances.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">It is an object of the present invention to overcome or ameliorate at least one of the disadvantages of the prior art, or to provide a useful alternative. It is an object of an especially preferred form of the present invention to provide for a vaporising apparatus<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> (preferably portable) suitable for use in vaporising fumigants such as Vapormate® such that a substantially homogeneous distribution of the fumigant components is achievable.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, throughout the description and the claims, the words "comprise", "comprising", and the like are to be construed in an inclusive sense as opposed to an exclusive or exhaustive sense; that is to say, in the sense of "including, but not limited to".</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Although the invention has been described with reference to specific examples it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the invention may be embodied in many other forms.</p><heading id="h0001">Summary of the Invention</heading><p id="p0019" num="0019">According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided an apparatus for vaporising one or more volatile components within a solid or liquid fumigant, said apparatus comprising:

Foreseeably, in such applications, a revised control panel enclosure which does not impact the existing design/operation will be based on one of the standard solutions which industry-specific workers have developed for these environments. This revised design to undergo testing/approval by an approved authority.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0058" num="0058">Further refinements may relate to the temperature control system. The full capability of the digital controller has not been exploited yet. The controller has the option to run in "Hysteresis Mode" or "PID Mode" (<i>i.e.,</i> proportional-integral-derivative). The system has currently only been set up in Hysteresis Mode, which is a simple on/off mechanism based around a desired temperature set point.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">On the other hand, PID control is a control loop feedback mechanism which constantly calculates the difference between the measured operating temperature and the desired set point - and controls power input accordingly. This enables more stable temperature control and minimises over/under temperature variances.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">Further potential for development relates to the volume and capacity of the oil bath/coil. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the oil bath is approximately 10.5 L and the heat exchanger coil approximately 0.5 L water volume. A larger oil bath with a longer heat exchanger coil would increase the surface area for heat transfer. This could help to increase the throughput from the current 0.5/0.6 kg/min up to 1 kg/min without an increase in power input.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">This would result in a larger, heavier and more expensive vaporiser, but may be a benefit to some customers. Typical application times for shipping containers of 20 to 30 minutes are not significant when the total retention/fumigation time can be up to 24 h. A reduction in application time from 20 min to 10 min does not offer a major improvement on the overall fumigation time. The high flow option may be of interest to fumigators treating extremely large volumes, e.g., storage holds in ships, etc.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">In respect of the instrumentation/digital controller outputs, the unit includes basic instrumentation to fulfil control and safety requirements. There are analogue temperature gauges on the inlet and outlet manifolds to indicate gas inlet and outlet temperatures. The outlet manifold also has an analogue pressure gauge to indicate back pressure within the system when operating.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">All of these devices could be replaced with more sophisticated digital sensors which would provide greater accuracy and the potential for data logging the information.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">In addition the digital temperature controller could be replaced with a more sophisticated device which could provide numerous audible/visual alarms, full data logging of all operations and facilities to download to PC/laptop via cables or wireless connections.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p><p id="p0065" num="0065">In respect of flow control, the outlet manifold incorporates an orifice plate to control the flow rate. This ensures that a steady flow is maintained which is not too high for the product to be fully vaporised.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">The original prototype used a needle valve but it was felt the variable flow should be removed so that there was a set flow which would not exceed the vaporiser capacity. The orifice plate could be replaced with a more sophisticated flow control device which is self-monitoring/self-adjusting. Again, more sophisticated devices are probably cost prohibitive for the industry.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">The invention also has scope of automated dosing. Fumigation is traditionally controlled by weight. The volume of product required to treat a chamber is based on a dose rate of grams per cubic metre. From this, a total weight of product required can be calculated. Typically, the fumigant cylinders are placed on a scale and the weight monitored during dosing. When the target weight is reached, the concentration of fumigant within the chamber is checked with a monitor.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">An automated system could be developed which incorporated the data from the load cell/s so that flow is stopped automatically when the required dose weight has been dispensed.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">The inventive unit also incorporates support feet. These could be replaced by lockable castors to improve mobility.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the present invention is amenable to essentially any design/shape/capacity of oil bath; heating media (oils/other heating fluids); type/shape/construction of heating element; more sophisticated/integrated control system (link in gas inlet/gas outlet temperature); different materials/methods of construction (composite mouldings/extrusions); PLC control/integrated circuit board to replace conventional electrics; and the incorporation of a load cell/weigh station for automated dosing.</p><heading id="h0011"><b>Brief Description of the Figures</b></heading><p id="p0071" num="0071">A preferred embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying Figures, in which:

The end of the hose is connected to distribution pipework which can terminate anywhere within the container to be fumigated.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">The boiling point of Vapormate® is reputed to be 55 °C. Accordingly, the control panel (6) is set to maintain the oil bath temperature sufficiently above this value to ensure volatilisation of the consistent fumigant gases.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">When the required set temperature is achieved the cylinder valve (3) is manually opened to release the fumigant at a predetermined flow rate maintained by an orifice plate in the outlet manifold (11).
