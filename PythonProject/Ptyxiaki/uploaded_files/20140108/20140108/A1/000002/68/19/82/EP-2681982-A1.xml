Agricultural work vehicles, such as tractors, may include one or more power take-off systems. For example, an agricultural work vehicle may include a power take-off system having a drive shaft at a rear end of the vehicle that provides a rotational output for operating an agricultural implement or an auxiliary system (e.g., a hydraulic pump, a generator, an air compressor, a water pump, etc.).</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Coupling an auxiliary system to a power take-off system of an agricultural work vehicle may provide various challenges. For example, the weight of an auxiliary system may use a number of mounting structures (e.g., brackets, clamps, pins, bolts, etc.) to attach the auxiliary system to the agricultural work vehicle to stabilize and support the auxiliary system. Furthermore, the auxiliary system may be aligned with the power take-off system using additional mounting structures (e.g., brackets, clamps, pins, bolts, etc.).

In certain embodiments, the agricultural work vehicle 10 may be a tractor, off-road vehicle, work vehicle, or any other suitable vehicle that may incorporate one or more power take-off systems. The illustrated vehicle 10 has a body 12 that houses an engine, transmission, cooling system, and power train (not separately shown). The body 12 may also house portions of a front mounted power take-off system. Further, the agricultural work vehicle 10 has a cabin 14 where an operator may sit or stand to operate the vehicle 10. Moreover, the vehicle 10 has two front wheels 16 and two rear wheels 18 that rotate to move the vehicle 10. As will be appreciated, the vehicle 10 is maneuvered using a steering wheel 20 that causes the front wheels 16 to turn. As illustrated, the wheels 16 are coupled to an axle 22 (e.g., fixed or suspended) that supports the wheels 16, and facilitates wheel rotation. Although a work vehicle 10 having wheels 16 and 18 is illustrated, in certain embodiments, a track system (e.g., or another system) may be used to move the vehicle 10. A rear mounted power take-off (PTO) system 24 is mounted to the rear of the agricultural work vehicle 10, and is used for driving moving parts of an implement or auxiliary system coupled to the rear of the agricultural work vehicle 10. As explained in detail below, the PTO system 24 includes a mounting surface that is configured to enable an auxiliary system to be directly mounted thereon, thereby obviating additional mounting structures (e.g., brackets, clamps, etc.).</p><p id="p0008" num="0008"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> is a side view of an embodiment of the PTO system 24 (e.g., PTO device) having a mounting surface 26 for mounting an auxiliary system 27 to the PTO system 24. The PTO system 24 includes a drive shaft 28 to provide rotational energy to drive the auxiliary system 27 when coupled thereto. As may be appreciated, the drive shaft 28 may be female as illustrated, or male, depending on the configuration of the power take-off system 24. Furthermore, the drive shaft 28 may be splined in a manner suitable for gripping a mating splined shaft. As illustrated, the drive shaft 28 has an opening with a diameter 30 for driving a mating drive shaft having the same diameter. The diameter 30 may be any suitable size (e.g., approximately 1 3/4 inches, 1 3/8 inches, etc.).</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The mounting surface 26 includes a pilot 32 that is used to facilitate lateral alignment of the PTO system 24 with the auxiliary system 27. As such, the pilot 32 is configured to engage with a complimentary pilot of the auxiliary system 27.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> Accordingly, the pilot 32 may be any suitable size. As illustrated, the pilot 32 may extend into the mounting surface 26 (e.g., counterbore), or, in some embodiments, the pilot 32 may extend outwardly from the mounting surface 26. Although the pilot 32 is illustrated as being circular, in certain embodiments, the pilot 32 may be any suitable shape. Furthermore, the mounting surface 26 includes threaded apertures 34 and 36 to facilitate coupling the auxiliary system 27 to the PTO system 24. The mounting surface 26 also includes an opening 38 that may be coupled to the auxiliary system 27. For example, in some embodiments, the opening 38 may include a drain to enable hydraulic fluid to drain from a case drain of the auxiliary system 27 (e.g., the case drain of a hydraulic pump). As such, the opening 38 may be configured to enable hydraulic fluid to flow through the mounting surface 26 to a reservoir of the work vehicle 10.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">A PTO shaft adaptor 40 may be coupled to the mounting surface 26 (e.g., inserted into the drive shaft 28) to facilitate use of different sized driven shafts. Accordingly, the PTO shaft adaptor 40 includes a male end 42 configured to mate with the drive shaft 28. The male end 42 has a diameter 44 that matches the diameter 30 of the drive shaft 28 to facilitate mating. For example, if the diameter 30 of the drive shaft 28 is approximately 1 3/8 inches, then the diameter 44 of the male end 42 has a matching diameter of approximately 1 3/8 inches. Likewise, if the diameter 30 of the drive shaft 28 is approximately 1 3/4 inches, then the diameter 44 of the male end 42 has a matching diameter of approximately 1 3/4 inches. Furthermore, the PTO shaft adaptor 40 includes a female end 46 configured to mate with a driven shaft of the auxiliary system 27. The female end 46 has a diameter 48 that may be any suitable size. For example, in certain embodiments, the diameter 48 may be approximately 1 inch.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The auxiliary system 27 may be any suitable system that may be coupled to the PTO system 24. For example, the auxiliary system 27 may be a hydraulic pump, a generator, an air compressor, or a water pump. Furthermore, the auxiliary system 27 includes a body 50 having components used to operate the auxiliary system 27. Moreover, a male driven shaft 52 extends from the auxiliary system 27, and is configured to mate with and to be driven by the PTO system 24. As illustrated, the driven shaft 52 has a diameter 54. In certain embodiments, the diameter 54 of the driven shaft 52 may match the diameter 30 of the drive shaft 28; however, in other embodiments, the diameter 54 of the driven shaft 52 may match the diameter 48 of<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> the female end 46 of the shaft adaptor 40. In such embodiments, the diameter 54 may be approximately 1 inch. Furthermore, to attach the auxiliary system 27 to the PTO system 24, the PTO shaft adaptor 40 may be inserted within the drive shaft 28 of the PTO system 24, and the driven shaft 52 of the auxiliary system 27 may be inserted within the PTO shaft adaptor 40. Accordingly, the PTO system 24 may be used to drive the driven shaft 52 of the auxiliary system 27.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The auxiliary system 27 also includes a pilot 56 configured to mate with the pilot 32 of the PTO system 24. As discussed above, the pilot 56 is configured to facilitate lateral alignment of the PTO system 24 and the auxiliary system 27. As illustrated, the pilot 56 extends out from the auxiliary system 27; however, in other embodiments, the pilot 56 may extend into the auxiliary system 27. The auxiliary system 27 includes an opening 57 that may be coupled to the opening 38 of the PTO system 24. For example, in some embodiments, the opening 57 may include a case drain to enable hydraulic fluid to drain from the auxiliary system 27 and to enable hydraulic fluid to flow through the mounting surface 26 of the PTO system 24 to a reservoir of the work vehicle 10. The auxiliary system 27 also includes a mounting structure 58 used to secure the auxiliary system 27 to the PTO system 24. Furthermore, the mounting structure 58 includes an aperture 60 configured to align with the threaded aperture 36. During assembly, a fastener 62 (e.g., bolt, screw, etc.) is attached to the apertures 36 and 60 to secure the auxiliary system 27 to the PTO system 24. Furthermore, the mounting structure 58 includes an aperture 64 configured to align with the threaded aperture 34. Moreover, during assembly, a fastener 66 (e.g., bolt, screw, etc.) is attached to the apertures 34 and 64 to secure the auxiliary system 27 to the PTO system 24.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">As illustrated, the auxiliary system 27 may be mounted to the PTO system 24 using fasteners 62 and 66, and without additional mounting structures (e.g., brackets, clamps, etc.). This is facilitated by the mounting surface 26 of the PTO system 24 having the same mounting configuration (e.g., hole pattern and pilot diameter) as the auxiliary system 27. Accordingly, the hole patterns and the pilot diameters of the mounting structure 58 and the mounting surface 26 are the same. In certain embodiments, the mounting surface 26 of the PTO system 24 and the mounting structure 58 of the auxiliary system 27 comply with Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) standard J744. In other embodiments, the mounting surface 26 of the PTO system 24 and the mounting structure 58 of the auxiliary system 27 may<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> comply with any proprietary or non-proprietary standard. For example, the mounting surface 26 of the PTO system 24 and the mounting structure 58 of the auxiliary system 27 may have any suitable hole patterns and pilot diameters. As such, the auxiliary system 27 may be easily installed and/or removed from the PTO system 24. Furthermore, an auxiliary system 27 may be swapped with another auxiliary system 27 in an efficient manner.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> is a back view of an embodiment of a four bolt mounting surface 26 of the PTO system 24.
