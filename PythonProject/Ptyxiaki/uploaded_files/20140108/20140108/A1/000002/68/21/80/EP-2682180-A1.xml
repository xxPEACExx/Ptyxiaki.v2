It can be difficult and costly to dispose of the large quantities of fly ash that are produced, particularly due to controls on the disposal of such materials in landfill sites. However, it has been discovered that the fly ash can be used to form aggregates or cementitious materials and it will be appreciated that such use avoids the difficult and costly disposal procedures.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A typical manufacturing plant for producing lightweight aggregates from fly ash comprises a hopper for storing pulverised fly ash and a screw-conveyor for delivering controlled quantities of the pulverised fly ash to a mixer unit, where it is mixed with a certain amount of water. The slurry-like mixture is then fed by a conveyor at a controlled speed into a pelletiser, which rotates around an inclined axis such that the mixture is formed into pellets which are eventually discharged from the pelletiser by continued rotation thereof.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The pellets are then conveyed to a sintering device, such as a sinter strand, where they are formed into a bed on top of a movable grate or mesh. The bed of material, which contains carbon, is then is ignited from above and moved away from the ignition source over a downdraft, which causes the ignition to propagate downwardly through the bed of material in a controlled manner to fully combust the material. The resultant combusted material is both strong and lightweight and thereby lends itself to use as an aggregate for the building industry.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">A disadvantage of the above-mentioned process for making lightweight aggregates from sintered fly ash is that there may be a mismatch between the supply of fly ash from the electrical power station and the demand of the lightweight aggregate plant. For example, at times of high electrical output a surplus of fly ash is produced and this may occur at times when the demands on the lightweight aggregate plant are low. Conversely, high demands on the lightweight aggregate plant may occur when the output of electricity and hence the supply of fly ash is low.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">A first problem of the above-mentioned existing process for making lightweight aggregates from sintered fly ash is that the surplus fly ash either has to be disposed of or stored in a location where none will blow away and contaminate the surrounding environment. Hitherto, this problem has been solved by adding water to the fly ash to allow for stockpiling or land filling in a conditioned form for disposal by sluicing into settling ponds or lagoons. An advantage of conditioning fly ash in this way is that it reduces any risk of the fly ash being blown away. However, surplus water from lagoons and lakes of conditioned fly ash can pollute the water table and surrounding environment.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">European Patent Application No <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="EP10710612A"><text>10710612.2</text></patcit>, from which this application is divided, discloses an apparatus for producing lightweight aggregate which alleviates the above-mentioned problems and comprises a pelletiser, means for mixing pulverised fly ash with water and means for feeding the mixture to the pelletiser, wherein means are also provided feeding conditioned fly ash to the pelletiser.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The ability of the apparatus to use either pulverised or conditioned fly ash enables aggregate to be produced from pulverised or conditioned fly ash when demands on aggregate are high compared with electrical output, thereby utilising any conditioned fly ash that is produced when demands on aggregates are low compared with electrical output.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The mixing means may be arranged to receive pulverised and conditioned fly ash, said feeding means being arranged to feed the pelletiser from the output of the mixer.

The apparatus comprises a plurality of identical input stages e.g. 10 connected in parallel. The number of operational input stages 10 can be selected as desired to suit demand.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">Each stage comprises a silo 11 for storing dry pulverised fly ash and an input 12 for receiving wet conditioned fly ash, which can be delivered to the apparatus using a plant machine 13. A tank 14 for storing liquid additive is arranged to supply additive to each stage via respective ducts 15.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">The output of the silo 11 is connected by a valve 17 to a screw-conveyor 16 which delivers the pulverised fly ash to a pin mixer 18 via a device 19 which weighs the quantity of pulverised fly ash being delivered. The input 12 for conditioned fly ash delivers the conditioned fly ash to a mixer 20, where it can be mixed with water delivered by water inlet 21. In accordance with the first aspect of the present invention, the outlet of the conditioned fly ash mixer 20 can be fed into the inlet of the mixer 18 in parallel with the pulverised fly ash from the hopper 11.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">The apparatus can selectively use pulverised and/or conditioned fly ash, thus enabling aggregate to be produced from pulverised or conditioned fly ash when demands on aggregate are high compared with electrical output. In this manner, any conditioned fly ash that is produced when demands on aggregates are low compared with electrical output is utilised.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0069" num="0069">The mixer 18 can mix pulverised with conditioned fly ash if the water content of the conditioned fly ash is too high. Alternatively, the mixer 18 can mix conditioned fly ash with water if the water content of the conditioned fly ash is too low. A drier (not shown) may be provided for drying the conditioned fly ash if the water content is too high. The drier may use waste energy recovered from a sintering device of the apparatus, which will be described hereinafter. A device (not shown) may be provided for determining the water content of the conditioned fly ash prior to feeding it to the mixer 20, where water can be added if the water content is too low.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">A controlled amount of water is fed into the mixer 18 via inlet 42 and optionally via a heater 41 which heats the water to between 15 and 25 degrees centigrade, for example using heat recovered from a sintering device of the apparatus. The ducts 15 carrying liquid additive also fed into the mixer 18. The output of the mixer 18 is fed at a controlled rate into a pan pelletiser 23 via a conveyor 22. In accordance with the second aspect of the present invention, water is fed into the pelletiser 23 via a heater 24 which heats the water to between 15 and 25 degrees centigrade, for example using heat recovered from the sintering device of the apparatus.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">The pan pelletiser 23 rotates about an inclined generally upright rotary axis and, in use, the output from the mixer 18 forms into pellets which are eventually discharged from the pelletiser 23 into a collection chute 25. The addition of the hot water reduces surface tension and thereby makes pelletisation easier and faster.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> of the drawings, the output of the pelletiser chute 25 falls on to a conveyor 26, which also receives the output from chutes of other input stages arranged in parallel with the input stage 10. Additional conveyors 27 may receive the output from chutes of other input stages.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">In accordance with the third aspect of the present invention, the output from the or each conveyor 26,27 falls onto a collection conveyor 28, which is controlled to run in a reverse direction for a period after start up of any input stage e.g. 10. In this manner, any unsatisfactory pellets that are produced during start up fall onto a conveyor 29, which carries them to a point where they are discharged to form a pile<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> 30. Material from the pile 30 may be re-introduced into the apparatus as conditioned fly ash via the input 12.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">Once a suitable time period has elapsed, the conveyor 28 runs forwardly to carry the pellets to a sorting device 36 arranged to only allow pellets below a certain size to move onto a conveyor 37 which carries the pellets to the sintering device 31.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3</figref> of the drawings, the sorting device 36 comprises a rotary-mesh 40 drum arranged for rotation at a downwardly-inclined angle of approximately 20 degrees to the horizontal. In accordance with the fourth aspect of the present invention, the output of the conveyor 28 is fed into the upper end of the drum 40, whereupon smaller particles fall through the apertures in the side wall of the drum 40 as they are carried towards the opposite end thereof. The smaller particles are collected by the conveyor 37 and carried to the sintering device 31. The larger particles are carried completely along the length of the drum 40 where they fall into an output chute 38 which delivers them to another pile of material, which can be re-introduced into the apparatus as conditioned fly ash via the input 12.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">Referring to again to <figref idrefs="f0002">Figure 2</figref> of the drawings, at the sintering device 31, the pellets are loaded into carriages (not shown) mounted on a conveyor 32. The pellets are loaded into each carriage to form a bed of pellets of uniform depth. Each carriage has opposite side and end walls, an open top and a bottom wall formed of a mesh or a grate. The carriages then advance along the conveyor 32 under an ignition hood 35, which ignites the upper layer of the pellet bed. A fan unit 33 draws air through the conveyor 32 and carriages to create a downdraft which causes the ignition of the pellets to slowly propagate downwardly through the bed of each carriage at a controlled rate.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">The exclusion by the sorting device 36 of pellets above a certain size prevents them from being loaded into the sintering carriages where there is a risk that they can explode and form dust or discontinuities in the pellet bed.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">At the end of the conveyor 32, the combustion of the pellets is complete and the resultant for material can be collected at the hopper 34 for use as a lightweight aggregate.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56983137" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --><claim
