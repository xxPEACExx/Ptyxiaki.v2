Because the number of external lead wire increases when the number of heating coils is increased, the external lead wire protruding out of the coil base is disadvantageously increased, causing a problem in efficiency in assembling the coil unit. Furthermore, with the increased number of external lead wires of the heating coils, the cooling air might be blocked, which might deteriorate the cooling effect.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The present invention is made to overcome the foregoing problems and an object thereof is to provide a heating cooker that, even if with a plurality of heating coils, does not require an increased number of external lead wires,<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> does not reduce the cooling effect, and has good efficiency in assembling.</p><heading id="h0007">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006">A heating cooker of the invention includes a main body constituting an outer wall; a top plate that is provided on a top side of the main body and on which a cooking container is placed; a coil base that is arranged under the top plate, and on an inner side of which a plurality of heating coils are arranged; and connecting means configured to connect a lead wire for one of heating coils paired for mutual connection, of the plurality of heating coils, to a lead wire for the other of the paired heating coil, in which the connecting means is provided on the inner side of the coil base.</p><heading id="h0008">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">According to the present invention, the lead wires for the heating coils paired for mutual connection of the plurality of heating coils are connected to one another by the connecting means provided on the inner side of the coil base. Accordingly, it is possible to easily connect the lead wires without causing the lead wires to protrude out of the coil base, and hence, workability is improved. Furthermore, since, as stated above, the lead wires for the pair of heating coils can be connected to one another via the connecting means, the number of external lead wires protruding out of the coil base can be reduced. In addition, since the lead lines can be wired on the inner side of the coil base and the number of external lead wires can be suppressed even if the number of heating coils is increased. Hence there is no longer blocking of the cooling air by the increased number of external lead wires.</p><heading id="h0009">Brief Description of Drawings</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008"><ul><li>[<figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1] Fig. 1</figref> is a perspective view of a heating cooker according to an embodiment.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2] Fig. 2</figref> is a perspective view of the heating cooker according to the embodiment in which a top plate is removed.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3] Fig. 3</figref> is an enlarged top view of a coil unit on the left side of the heating cooker of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4] Fig. 4</figref> is a bottom view of the coil unit in which the coil unit of<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref> has been turned around by 180 degrees.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 5] Fig. 5</figref> is an enlarged plan view of a terminal block that is positioned on the lower side among three terminal blocks in the bottom view of <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref>.</li><li>[<figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 6] Fig. 6</figref> is an enlarged cross-sectional view of a terminal block of <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref> seen from the side.</li></ul></p><heading id="h0010">Description of Embodiment</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009"><figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref> is a perspective view of a heating cooker according to an embodiment. <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref> is a perspective view of the heating cooker according to the embodiment in which a top plate is removed. <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref> is an enlarged top view of a coil unit on the left side of the heating cooker of <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 2</figref>. <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref> is a bottom view of the coil unit in which the coil unit of <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 3</figref> has been turned around by 180 degrees. <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 5</figref> is an enlarged plan view of a terminal block that is positioned on the lower side among three terminal blocks in the bottom view of <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref>. <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 6</figref> is an enlarged cross-sectional view of the terminal block of <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref> seen from the side.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Referring to theses diagrams, the heating cooker of the embodiment includes a heating cooker main body 1 that constitutes an outer wall; a top plate 2 that is mounted so as to cover the top opening surface of the heating cooker main body 1 and that has an outer frame in its outer circumference; a cover 3 of an intake/exhaust port, in which the cover 3 is detachably provided to the outer frame in the rear portion of the top plate 2; an operating unit 4 arranged on the front side of the heating cooker main body 1, and a grill door 5 provided on the front side of the heating cooker main body 1 and adjacent to the operating unit 4. The top plate 2 is constituted by a heat-resistant tempered glass, for example. For example, two coil units 6 and 7 and a single heater unit 8 are arranged under the top plate 2.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">As will be described later, the coil unit 6 is provided with a plurality of heating coils. The coil unit 7 is provided with a ring-shaped heating coil of a small diameter and a ring-shaped heating coil of a large diameter. Further, the heater unit 8 is provided with a radiant heater. When a high-frequency<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> current flows in a heating coil described above, magnetic flux is generated from the heating coil in accordance with the high-frequency current, and a pan or the like that is a cooking container placed on the top plate 2 is induction-heated by the magnetic flux. In place of the heater unit 8, a coil unit may be used that has an outer diameter smaller than that of the coil unit 7.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0002">Figs. 3</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0003">4</figref>, the coil unit 6 described above includes a coil base 61, a plurality of ferrite pieces 63, and a plurality of heating coils 64, 65, and 66. The coil base 61 has a disk shape and has a center support 62 positioned in a central portion thereof, a plurality of beams 62a that extend radially with this center support 62 at its center, and a ring-shaped side plate 62b that is connected to each end of the beams 62a. Furthermore, each of the beams 62a has a U-shape having a cross-section that opens downwards, and the ferrite pieces 63 are fitted in and fixed to the openings. In addition, the heating coils 64, 65, and 66 described later are provided on the top side surface of the coil base 61, that is, the opposite side to the ferrite pieces 63 side of the beams 62a.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The ferrite pieces 63 each serves as a magnetic path of the magnetic flux that has leaked downwards and laterally of the magnetic fluxes generated from the heating coils 64, 65, and 66. With this function, it is possible to prevent the magnetic flux from leaking from the coil unit 6, and thus prevent leaking such that there is no adverse effect to electronic components on the circuit board provided in the operating unit 4 and to electronic components on the circuit board configured to supply high-frequency currents to the heating coils 64, 65, and 66.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The heating coil 64 of the coil unit 6 has a ring shape and is arranged so as to surround the outer circumference of the center support 62 with the center support 62 at its center. The heating coil 65 has a ring shape that is larger than the outer diameter of the heating coil 64 and is arranged so as to surround the outer circumference of the heating coil 64. The heating coils 66 include, for example, four heating coils 66a, 66b, 66c, and 66d. Each of the heating coils 66a, 66b, 66c, and 66d has a deformed-ring-shape that extends<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> in the circumferential direction of the coil base 61. The heating coils 66a, 66b, 66c, and 66d are arranged with equal spacing therebetween around the heating coil 65 in the circumferential direction.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The heating coils 64 and 65 that are arranged in the center portion of the coil unit 6 are connected in series, for example.

The above-described first groove 17a, second groove 17b, and third groove 17c are integrally formed with the cross-sectional shape being a U-shaped groove shape. In a planar view, the shape of the terminal block 17 is a crank shape.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Furthermore, connecting means 16 is mounted inside the first groove 17a of the terminal block 17. The connecting means 16 electrically connects terminals 17d of lead wires that are each arranged in the second groove 17b and the third groove 17c. The connecting means 16 includes a metal plate made of metal that has conductivity and is secured to the terminal block 17 by a screw 17e. Note that each terminal 17d of the lead wire is secured to the connection means 16 by a screw 17f.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The terminal block 17 configured in this way is arranged such that the longitudinal axis of the first groove 17a in which the connecting means 16 is provided is directed to the center of the coil base 61 and secured to the coil<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> base 61 with a screw 17g, and further, such that a portion of the terminal block 17 is placed in between the neighboring ferrite pieces 63 (see <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 6</figref>).</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Note that one screw may serve both as the screw 17g used to secure the terminal block 17 to the coil base 61 and as the screw 17e for securing each connecting means 16 to the terminal block 17. For example, the connecting means 16 and the terminal block 17 are screwed together to the coil base 61 with a single screw. With this configuration, it is possible to achieve reduction of the number of parts and reduction of man-hours (reduction in steps of the screw fastening) in the manufacturing process.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In the configuration of the terminal block 17 described above, a terminal block 17 to which the connecting means 16 is installed has been described.

The number of external lead wires 9, 10, 12, and 13 are four, and there are five wires, including the common line 11, for the five heating coils. This common line 11 is a common line for the circuit of the heating coils 66a and 66c and the circuit of the heating coils 66b and 66d. These three circuits can be switched in accordance with the pan size and/or the type of cooking.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In the present embodiment, as described above, advantageous effects set forth below can be obtained.
<ol><li>(1) The lead wires 91, 92, 93, 101, 102, and 103 of the heating coils 66a and 66c and the heating coils 66b and 66d opposed to each other are connected to one another using crank-shaped terminal blocks 17 that are arranged on the inner side of the coil base 61. Accordingly, the number of external lead wires 9 and 10 that protrude outside the coil base 61 becomes fewer, and consequently, the number of the wires including the common line 11 and the external lead wires 12 and 13 of the heating coils 64 and 65 is small, that is five.</li><li>(2) Since each terminal block 17 has a crank-shape, each of the lead wires 91, 92, 93, 101, 102, and 103 can be wired on the inner side of the coil base 61 along the circumferential direction without crossing each other. In particular, in the terminal blocks 17, since the longitudinal axis of each first groove 17a in which the corresponding one of the connecting means 14, 15, and 16 is provided is directed to the center of the coil base 61, it is possible to effectively utilize the space of the coil base 61 in the diametric direction and arrange the terminal blocks 17.<br/>
<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> -->Furthermore, in order to minimize protrusion out of the coil base 61 in the thickness direction, a portion of each terminal block 17 is placed in between the neighboring ferrite pieces 63. Therefore, the thickness of the coil base 61 can be suppressed.</li><li>(3) By wiring on the inner side of the coil base 61 along the circumferential direction, the embodiment is configured such that lead wires except for the external lead wires 9, 10, 12, and 13 (including the common line 11) that are connected to the substrate do not protrude out of the coil base. Accordingly, it is possible to secure a space around the coil unit 6 and more easily use the coil unit in other types of heating cooker than conventional ones.</li><li>(4) Since the present embodiment is structured such that only the external lead wires 9, 10, 12, and 13 (including the common line 11) are exposed from the coil base 61, connecting the lead wire in a succeeding process is facilitated and errors in assembling can be reduced.</li><li>(5) The wiring on the inner side of the coil base 61 eliminates the disadvantage that the cooling air blown to the bottom face of the coil unit 6 is blocked.</li><li>(6) Since each of the lead wires 91, 92, 93, 101, 102, and 103 has the same length, fabrication and management of the lead wire is facilitated, and, further, wiring work is facilitated.</li></ol></p><heading id="h0011">Reference Signs List</heading><p id="p0026" num="0026">1 heating cooker main body; 2 top plate; 3 cover; 4 operating unit; 5 grill door; 6 coil unit; 61 coil base; 62 center support; 62a beam; 62b side plate of the coil base; 63 ferrite piece; 64, 65, 66 heating coil; 67 support of the coil base; 7 coil unit; 8 heater unit; 9 external lead wire; 91, 92, 93 lead wire; 10 external lead wire; 101, 102, 103 lead wire; 11 common line; 12, 13 external lead wire; 14, 15, 16 connecting means; 17 terminal block; 17a first groove; 17b second groove; 17c<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> third groove; 17d terminal of the lead wire; and 17e, 17f, 17g screw.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56982685" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A heating cooker, comprising:
