A driving belt engages the pulley and is actuated by the geared motor of the washing machine to drive the pulley and the drum shaft into rotation.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Within such a traditional technology a first important requirement is to obtain perfect coupling between the drum shaft and the pulley hub, in order to prevent mutual sliding between these two parts.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0008" num="0008">It is understood that, in lack of a stable rigid coupling, undesired clearance would easily occur between the pulley hub and the drum shaft, generating noisy dangerous vibrations.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">For such a reason, said ending pin of the drum shaft must be provided with two opposite planar sides, as well as a threaded ending section.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The pulley hub must be centrally provided with a housing adapted to exactly receive said shaped ending pin of the drum shaft with male-female coupling.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The next operation to be carried out from the outside of the pulley is the screwing of a nut that is engaged into said threaded ending section of the ending pin of the drum shaft. After completing said coupling between nut and pin, the nut is rigidly engaged against the external side of the pulley hub, thus firmly locking the pulley on the drum shaft.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Such an assembly technique between pulley and drum shaft has proved rather unsatisfactory in case of pulleys made of press-bent plate, wherein the hub for coupling with the ending pin of the shaft is reduced to a hole with very small depth of approximately 1.0-1.5mm equal to the low thickness of the plate.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The first problem with pulleys made of press-bent plate is the impossibility to use an ordinary nut to tighten the pulley on the shaft. As a matter of fact, although screwed until the end of its travel, the nut cannot tighten the pulley hub because of the low thickness of the press-bent plate pulley.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Such a first problem has been solved using expensive tightening nuts characterized by a bell-shaped flange that protrudes towards the pulley and tightens the pulley before the nut reaches the end of its screwing travel along the threaded ending section of the pulley shaft.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">For a better illustration of the prior art, reference is made to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, which shows the driving unit provided with said special nut.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Referring to <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 1</figref>, the washing machine comprises a shaft (A) with end provide with ending pin (1).
