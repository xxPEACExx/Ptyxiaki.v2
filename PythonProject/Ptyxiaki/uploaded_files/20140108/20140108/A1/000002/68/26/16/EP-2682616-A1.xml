In this case, if the width of the bead 01b is smaller than the diameter of a head portion 03a of the bolt 03, the head portion 03a of the bolt 03 cannot be fitted within the bead 01b, and there is the problem that the member to be secured cannot be fixed to the bottom of the bead 01b. If, in order to avoid this, the member to be secured is fixed to the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> surfaces 01a and 01a of the member 01, since a space is present between a lower face of the member to be secured and the bottom of the bead 01b, there is the problem that the tightening force of the bolt 03 cannot be fully transmitted to the member to be secured.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">If, in order to fix a member to be secured to one surface 01a of the member 01 while avoiding the position of the bead 01b, a nut 02 is disposed on the reverse side of the surface 01a, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 7 (B)</figref>, since the nut 02 interferes with the bead 01b, there is a possibility that it will not be able to be disposed on the reverse side of the surface 01a.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The present invention has been accomplished in light of the above-mentioned circumstances, and it is an object thereof to provide a nut equipped with a flange that can easily and reliably fix a member to the surface of another member having a groove-shaped bead formed thereon.</p><heading id="h0007">MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">In order to attain the above object, according to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a bracket with nut that is fitted into an interior of a groove-shaped bead formed on a surface of a member, the bracket with nut comprising a nut part into which a bolt is screwed, and a bracket part that supports the nut part and is retained by an opening formed in a bottom wall of the bead, the bracket part comprising a base portion that abuts against the surface on opposite sides of the bead, a pair of first leg portions that extend in a direction in which the first leg portions approach each other along the bottom wall of the bead from two positions, in a longitudinal direction of the bead, of the base portion, a pair of second leg portions that extend from tips of the pair of first leg portions while extending through the opening, and a pair of third leg portions that extend in a direction in which the third leg portions approach each other from the tips of the pair of second leg portions and are opened out by the bolt, and the nut part being provided at a position, sandwiched by the pair of first leg portions, of the base portion.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Further, according to a second aspect of the present invention, in addition to the first aspect, the second leg portion has a width that is substantially equal to the width, in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the bead, of the opening.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Furthermore, according to a third aspect of the present invention, in addition to the first or second aspect, the bracket part is formed by bending a single sheet of metal plate.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Moreover, according to a fourth aspect of the present invention, in addition to any one of the first to third aspects, the nut part is formed integrally with the bracket part.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Further, according to a fifth aspect of the present invention, in addition to the first or second aspect, the bracket part is formed as a unit from a resin.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Furthermore, according to a sixth aspect of the present invention, in addition to the fifth aspect, the nut part is formed integrally with the bracket part.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">A vehicle body frame 11 of embodiments corresponds to the member of the present invention.</p><heading id="h0008">EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0015" num="0015">In accordance with the first aspect of the present invention, the bracket with nut fitted into the interior of the groove-shaped bead formed on the surface of the member includes the nut part into which the bolt is screwed and the bracket part that supports the nut part and is retained in the opening formed in the bottom wall of the bead. Since the bracket part includes the base portion that abuts against the surface of the member on opposite sides of the bead, the pair of first leg portions extending in a direction in which they approach each other along the bottom wall of the bead from two positions, along the longitudinal direction of the bead, of the base portion, the pair of second leg portions extending from the tips of the pair of first leg portions while extending through the opening, and the pair of third leg portions extending in a direction in which they approach each other from the tips of the pair of second leg portions and being opened out by the bolt, in a state in which the second leg portions and the third leg portions of the bracket part are inserted into the opening of the bottom wall of the bead, by screwing the bolt into the nut part provided on the base portion the third leg portions are pushed by the bolt to thus open out the second leg portions on the interior side of the opening, thus retaining the bracket part so that it does not fall out of the opening and thereby enabling another member to be secured to the base portion of the member by screwing the bolt into the nut part.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">As a result, even if the width of the bead is narrow, not only is it possible to enhance the securing rigidity by utilizing the entire face of the base portion straddling the surfaces of the member on opposite sides of the bead as a securing face for another member, but it also becomes possible to increase the diameter of the head portion of the bolt without it being limited by the width of the bead, thereby ensuring a sufficient tightening force. Furthermore, when a moment that attempts to collapse the bracket in the longitudinal direction of the bead acts thereon, the base portion straddling the surfaces of the member on opposite sides of the bead exhibits resistance to the moment to thus prevent the bracket part from collapsing, and when a moment that attempts to collapse the bracket in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the bead acts thereon, the second leg portions engaging with the interior side of the opening exhibit resistance to the moment to thus prevent the bracket part from collapsing.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Furthermore, in accordance with the second aspect of the present invention, since the width of the second leg portions is substantially equal to the width, in the direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the bead, of the opening, it is possible to prevent the bracket part from rotating by being dragged when a bolt is screwed into the nut part in a state in which the second leg portions are inserted into the opening, thus enhancing the workability.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Moreover, in accordance with the third aspect of the present invention, since the bracket part is formed by bending a single sheet of metal plate, it is possible to simplify the structure and reduce the production cost.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Furthermore, in accordance with the fourth aspect of the present invention, since the nut part and the bracket part are formed as a unit, it is possible to cut the number of components and simplify the structure.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Moreover, in accordance with the fifth aspect of the present invention, since the bracket part is formed from a resin as a unit, it is possible to simplify the structure and reduce the production cost.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Furthermore, in accordance with the sixth aspect of the present invention, since the nut part and the bracket part are formed as a unit, it is possible to reduce the number of components and simplify the structure.</p><heading id="h0009">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0022" num="0022"><ul><li>[<figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1] FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram showing a state in which a stay is fixed to a vehicle body frame using a nut equipped with a flange.

When the second leg portions 13c and 13c and the third leg portions 13d and 13d of the bracket part 13 are fitted into the opening 11c of the vehicle body frame 11, a gap L3 (see <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4 (A)</figref>) of the pair of third leg portions 13d and 13d is set smaller than a diameter L4 (see <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3 (A)</figref>) of a shaft portion 15a of a bolt 15. Therefore, when the bolt 15 is screwed into the female thread 14b of the nut part 14, the shaft portion 15a of the bolt 15 pushes apart the gap L3 between the pair of third leg portions 13d and 13d, and the pair of second leg portions 13c and 13c connected to the third leg portions 13d and 13d are opened out into a downward divergent shape.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">A stay 16 formed by bending a metal plate is fixed by being held between the base portion 13a of the bracket part 13 and a head portion 15a of the bolt 15, which extends through a bolt hole 16a formed in the base side of the stay 16, and a wire harness 17 disposed along the vehicle body frame 11 is supported on a loop portion at the tip of the stay 16.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The operation of the embodiment of the present invention having the above arrangement is now explained.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">First, as shown by a chain line in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3 (A)</figref>, the third leg portions 13d and 13d and the second leg portions 13c and 13c of the bracket part 13 of the bracket with nut 12 are inserted into the opening 11c of the bottom wall b of the bead 11b of the vehicle body frame 11, and a horizontal part of the first leg portions 13b and 13b is made to abut against the bottom wall b of the bead 11b. In this arrangement, if lower parts of the second leg portions 13c and 13c are slightly opened up so that outer faces of the second leg portions 13c and 13c resiliently abut against the edge of the opening 11c, the attitude of the bracket with nut 12, which is provisionally supported in the opening 11c, is stabilized.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Subsequently, screwing the bolt 15, which extends through the bolt hole 16a of the stay 16 supporting the wire harness 17, into the female thread portion 14b of the nut part 14 of the bracket with nut 12 makes the shaft portion 15a of the bolt 15 push apart the gap between<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> the pair of third leg portions 13d and 13d, and as shown by the solid line in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3 (A)</figref> bent portions c and c between the first leg portions 13b and 13b and the second leg portions 13c and 13c engage with the edge of the opening 11c of the bottom wall b of the bead 11b, thus fixing the bracket with nut 12 to the vehicle body frame 11. The stay 16 sandwiched between the base portion 13a of the bracket with nut 12 and the head portion 15b of the bolt 15 is strongly fixed to the vehicle body frame 11.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In this way, in a state in which the bolt 15 is screwed into the nut part 14, the stay 16 is sandwiched between the flat base portion 13a and a flat lower face of the head portion 15b of the bolt 15, and it is therefore possible to make the tightening force of the bolt 15 act fully on the stay 16. Moreover, since the diameter of the head portion 15b of the bolt 15 can be made larger than the width of the bead 11b, it becomes possible to yet more reliably fix the stay 16.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Furthermore, even if a moment in the direction of arrow A in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3 (A)</figref> acts on the stay 16, since the bent portions c and c of the bracket part 13 engage with the edge of the opening 11c, tilting of the bracket with nut 12 is prevented. Even if a moment in the direction of arrow B in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3 (B)</figref> acts on the stay 16, since corners d and d at opposite ends of the base portion 13a of the bracket part 13 abut against the surfaces 11a and 11a of the vehicle body frame 11, tilting of the bracket with nut 12 is prevented.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">As hereinbefore described, in accordance with the present embodiment, even if the width of the bead 11b of the vehicle body frame 11 is narrow, it is possible to enhance the securing rigidity by utilizing the entire face of the base portion 13a straddling the surfaces 11a and 11a of the vehicle body frame 11 on opposite sides of the bead 11c as a securing face for the stay 16. Moreover, it becomes possible to increase the diameter of the head portion 15b of the bolt 15 without being limited by the width of the bead 11b, and a sufficient tightening force can be ensured. Furthermore, since the bracket with nut 12 can be fitted from the outside of the opening 11c, it can easily be fitted, even for a vehicle body frame 11 having a closed cross-section.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">A second embodiment of the present invention is now explained by reference to <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><heading id="h0013">SECOND EMBODIMENT</heading><p id="p0037" num="0037">In the second embodiment, compared with the first embodiment, the depth (side wall <u>a</u>, height of <u>a</u>) of a bead 11b of a vehicle body frame 11 is larger. Such a case can also be dealt with merely by lengthening first leg portions 13b and 13b of a bracket with nut 12. If the depth of the bead 11b is large, a bracket with nut 12 would easily tilt when a moment in direction A or a moment in direction B applies, but tilting of the bracket with nut 12 can be prevented by the same operation as that of the first embodiment.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">A third embodiment of the present invention is now explained by reference to <figref idrefs="f0006">FIG. 6</figref>.</p><heading id="h0014">THIRD EMBODIMENT</heading><p id="p0039" num="0039">In the first and second embodiments, the bracket part 13 of the bracket with nut 12 is formed from a metal plate, but in the third embodiment a bracket part 13 is formed as a unit from a synthetic resin.
