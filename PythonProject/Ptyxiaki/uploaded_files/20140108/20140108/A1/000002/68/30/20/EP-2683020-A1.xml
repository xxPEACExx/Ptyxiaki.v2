num="0001">The present invention relates to a dye-sensitized solar cell module.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">As a photoelectric conversion element module which is inexpensive and can give high photoelectric conversion efficiency, attention has been paid to dye-sensitized solar cell modules, and thus, development has been carried out in various ways in connection with dye-sensitized solar cell modules.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A dye-sensitized solar cell module generally includes plural dye-sensitized solar cells that are connected in series, and each dye-sensitized solar cell includes a working electrode, a counter electrode, and an annular sealing section that connects the working electrode and the counter electrode. The working electrode has a transparent substrate, a transparent conductive film formed thereon, and an oxide semiconductor layer provided on the transparent conductive film. As such a dye-sensitized solar cell module, for example, a solar cell module such as described in Patent Document 1 that will be described below is known. Patent Document 1 described below discloses a dye-sensitized solar cell module having two adjoining dye-sensitized solar cells, in which a conductive member extending from the counter electrode of one of the dye-sensitized solar cells, and a transparent conductive film of the other dye-sensitized solar cell are connected at a<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> site between adjoining sealing sections.</p><heading id="h0003">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent document</heading><p id="p0004" num="0004">Patent Document 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO2009133689A"><text>WO 2009/133689</text></patcit></p><heading id="h0005">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0006">PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">By the way, dye-sensitized solar cell modules are occasionally accommodated in casings with an opening. In this case, a dye-sensitized solar cell module is disposed such that all the light-receiving surfaces of dye-sensitized solar cells are accommodated inside an outer frame member provided along the periphery of the opening. Accordingly, as the total area of the light-receiving surfaces occupying the inner area of the outer frame member is larger, the aperture ratio increases.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Thus, having a high aperture ratio is required in dye-sensitized solar cell modules that are used outdoors, as well as in small-sized dye-sensitized solar cell modules in which the electric current generated by one dye-sensitized solar cell is less than 500 mA, or even in dye-sensitized solar cell modules that are utilized in places where the intensity of illumination is relatively low, such as indoors. Particularly, small-sized dye-sensitized solar cell modules, and dye-sensitized solar cell modules that are utilized in places where the intensity of illumination is relatively low have small areas of light reception and small amounts of light reception, as compared with those dye-sensitized solar cell modules that are used outdoors. Therefore, there is a demand for dye-sensitized solar cell modules to have particularly high aperture ratios so that power generation can be efficiently achieved.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">However, in the dye-sensitized solar cell module<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> described in Patent Document 1, in the two adjoining dye-sensitized solar cells, a conductive member extending from the counter electrode of one dye-sensitized solar cell and a transparent conductive film of the other dye-sensitized solar cell are connected at a site between adjoining sealing sections. That is, the connection point where the edge of the counter electrode and the transparent conductive film are connected, exists within a light-receiving area such as the inner region of the outer frame member. Therefore, the solar cell module cannot contribute to power generation as much as the portion of the area of the connection point, and the aperture ratio is decreased. Particularly, the area required for the connection point is usually almost invariable in dye-sensitized solar cell modules having large areas of light reception as well as in dye-sensitized solar cell modules having small areas of light reception. Therefore, if a connection point between two adjoining dye-sensitized solar cells is located within the light-receiving area, as the area of light reception of the dye-sensitized solar cell module is smaller, the aperture ratio decreases. Here, in order to obtain a high aperture ratio, it is contemplated to decrease the area of the connection point. However, in this case, the bonding strength at the connection point decreases, and thus the connection reliability is decreased. Therefore, it has been difficult to obtain a higher aperture ratio in the dye-sensitized solar cell module described in Patent Document 1.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Thus, the dye-sensitized solar cell module described in Patent Document 1 has room for an improvement in view of an enhancement in the aperture ratio.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Furthermore, in the dye-sensitized solar cell module described in Patent Document 1, adjoining dye-sensitized<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> solar cells are connected at a site between adjoining sealing sections. Therefore, there is a gap between two adjoining sealing sections, and the two adjoining sealing sections are respectively exposed at the gap. Therefore, moisture or air in the atmosphere can easily penetrate into the interior of the dye-sensitized solar cells. Accordingly, the dye-sensitized solar cell module described in Patent Document 1 has room for an improvement in view of durability, too.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In addition, it is also contemplated to decrease the sealing width of the sealing section of each of the dye-sensitized solar cells in order to increase the aperture ratio. However, in this case, although the aperture ratio is increased, the sealing performance is deteriorated, and durability is deteriorated.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Alternatively, in the case of using a metal substrate for the counter electrode of a dye-sensitized solar cell, in order to increase the aperture ratio, it is contemplated to electrically connect adjoining dye-sensitized solar cells outside the light-receiving area, by connecting an end of a jumper wire to the surface of the counter electrode on the opposite side of the working electrode, providing a protruding section that protrudes from the transparent conductive film of an adjoining dye-sensitized solar cell laterally to the sealing section on the outside of the sealing section, and connecting the other end of the jumper wire to this protruding section.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">However, in this case, the jumper wire tends to become long in order to connect the counter electrode of one dye-sensitized solar cell with the protruding section at the transparent conductive film of another dye-sensitized solar cell. Therefore, for example, upon handling a dye-sensitized solar cell module, if an<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> operator's hand is caught by the jumper wire, it is likely that excessive stress will be exerted on the connection point between the jumper wire and the counter electrode, or to the connection point between the jumper wire and the protruding section of the transparent conductive film. As a result, there is a risk that the connection reliability may be impaired.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Here, it is also contemplated to use a metal film instead of a jumper wire. In the case of using a metal film, the risk of the operator's hand being caught by the jumper wire is low. However, when the counter electrode of one dye-sensitized solar cell and a protruding section in the transparent conductive film of another dye-sensitized solar cell are connected by using a metal film, there is a risk that the metal film may be brought into contact with the counter electrode of the other dye-sensitized solar cell. As a result, defective operation occurs in the dye-sensitized solar cell module.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The present invention was achieved in view of the circumstances described above, and it is a first object of the present invention to provide a dye-sensitized solar cell module which can increase the aperture ratio and has excellent durability.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">It is a second object of the present invention to provide a dye-sensitized solar cell module which can sufficiently increase the connection reliability while increasing the aperture ratio, and can sufficiently prevent defective operation.</p><heading id="h0007">MEANS FOR SOLVING PROBLEM</heading><p id="p0016" num="0016">The inventors of the present invention conducted thorough investigations in order to achieve the first object, and as a result, the inventors found that the first object can be achieved by the following invention. Thus,<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> the inventors finally completed the present invention.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">That is, the present invention is a dye-sensitized solar cell module including plural dye-sensitized solar cells that are electrically connected in series, the dye-sensitized solar cell including a first electrode having a transparent substrate and a transparent conductive film provided on the transparent substrate; a second electrode that faces the first electrode; an oxide semiconductor layer provided on the first electrode or the second electrode; and an annular sealing section that joins the first electrode and the second electrode, in which the transparent substrate is constituted of a transparent substrate that is common to the plural dye-sensitized solar cells, the second electrodes of two adjoining dye-sensitized solar cells are separated apart from each other, and the sealing section has an annular first sealing section that is provided between the first electrode and the second electrode, with adjoining first sealing sections being integrated together.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">According to this dye-sensitized solar cell module, the first sealing sections are integrated together. Here, if adjoining first sealing sections are not integrated together, there will be two sites of the sealing section that are exposed to the atmosphere in the area between adjoining dye-sensitized solar cells. On the contrary, in the dye-sensitized solar cell module of the present invention, since adjoining first sealing sections are integrated together, there will be one site of the sealing section that is exposed to the atmosphere in the area between the adjoining dye-sensitized solar cells. Furthermore, as the first sealing sections are integrated together, the distance of penetration of moisture and the like from the atmosphere to the electrolyte increases.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> Therefore, the amount of moisture or air that penetrates from the outside of the dye-sensitized solar cell can be sufficiently reduced in the area between adjoining dye-sensitized solar cells. That is, the sealing ability of the dye-sensitized solar cell module can be sufficiently enhanced. Furthermore, according to the dye-sensitized solar cell module of the present invention, adjoining first sealing sections are integrated. For this reason, even if first sealing sections are integrated while the sealing width at the first sealing sections is made smaller than the sealing width of the first sealing sections that are not integrated together, a sufficient sealing width can be secured. That is, the adhesive strength between the first sealing section and the first electrode, and the adhesive strength between the first sealing section and the second electrode can be sufficiently increased while the aperture ratio is increased. As a result, the aperture ratio can be increased, and at the same time, when the dye-sensitized solar cell module is used at a high temperature, even if the electrolyte expands and excessive stress is exerted in the direction from the inner side of the first sealing section toward the outside, detachment of the first sealing section from the first electrode and the second electrode can be sufficiently suppressed. Thus, the dye-sensitized solar cell module can have excellent durability.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In the dye-sensitized solar cell module described above, it is preferable that the first sealing section be extended through the gap between the adjoining second electrodes, to the opposite side of the first electrode in the second electrode, and be adhered to an edge of the second electrode.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In this case, the first sealing section is extended to the surface of the opposite side of the first<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> electrode in the second electrode and is adhered to an edge of the second electrode.

On the contrary, in the DSC module 100, since adjoining first sealing sections 31A are integrated together, there will be one site of the sealing section that is exposed to the atmosphere in the area between<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> adjoining DSC's 50. That is, since the first sealing section 31 is composed of the annular section 31a and the partition section 31b, the site of the sealing section that is exposed to the atmosphere in the area between adjoining DSC's 50 is constituted of only one site at the partition section 31b. Furthermore, as the first sealing sections 31A are integrated together, the distance of penetration of moisture and the like from the atmosphere to the electrolyte 40 increases. Therefore, the amount of moisture or air that penetrates from the outside of the DSC 50 can be sufficiently reduced in the area between adjoining DSC's 50. That is, the sealing ability of the DSC module 100 can be sufficiently enhanced. Furthermore, according to the DSC module 100, adjoining first sealing sections 31A are integrated together.

Therefore, even if stress is exerted on the counter electrode 20 in a direction that is separated away from the working electrode 10, detachment of the electrodes is sufficiently suppressed by the second sealing section 32A.
