In particular, the invention relates to a device suitable for weighing elongate containers, i.e. containers having a longitudinal development that is preponderant with respect to the base dimensions thereof (for cylindrical containers, for example, an axial length that exceeds the diameter by at least three times), supplied along a conveyor line. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART </p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Weighing apparatus are known that are arranged at one or more tracts of a conveyor line for containers, for weighing the containers moved thereby: by way of example these applications include the use of two weighing devices arranged upstream and downstream of a filling station, respectively for weighing containers that are empty and full of product, in order to calculate a quantity of product placed inside them. As is known, the weighing method can include weighing all the containers supplied along the conveyor line (100% type weighing) or only some batches (statistical weighing). </p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Weighing devices are known that have been designed to enable both types of above-mentioned weighing, in order to guarantee maximum flexibility of use according to applicational needs. In this regard, an example is constituted by patent EP1194333, owned by the present Applicant, which discloses a weighing apparatus and a conveyor line designed to render high productivity specifically for the 100% weighing mode. The above-mentioned patent describes an operating unit for supplying containers along a conveyor line and for transferring the containers from the conveyor line to a weighing station, and vice versa. </p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The conveyor line comprises: a plurality of movement modules moved by a conveyor organ and conformed such as to define a series of V-shaped 
<!-- EPO <DP n="3"/>-->
 seatings suitable for receiving the containers by contacting, the neck thereof and/or the body thereof; and a sliding tract, positioned inferiorly of the movement modules and fixed to the frame, on which the container drags when drawn by the movement modules. The sliding tract exhibits an interruption at the weighing station. A mobile platform associated to the weighing station is provided for engaging in the sliding tract, in order to provide a continuity thereto; the platform is mobile between: a raised conveying position, in which it is arranged at the level of the sliding tract in order to restore the continuity and resting receive the containers supplied along the conveyor line; and a lowered weighing position, in which the platform is engaged with weighing means provided in the weighing station and arranged in proximity of the conveyor line, for temporarily restingly releasing the containers collected from the conveyor line onto the weighing means. The platform is provided with openings and the weighing means include complementary opening supports, such that when the platform loads the containers it is close to reaching the lowered weighing position and the supports freely engage in the openings, receiving the containers restingly so that they can be weighed. For the whole weighing step, therefore, the platform must remain in the lowered position; thereafter, the platform performs a return run such as to return the weighed containers onto the conveyor line, following the same trajectory as the one performed during the outward run. </p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The platform is moved by means of a pair of bar linkages arranged in the weighing station, symmetrically with respect to a transversal plane to the conveyor line. </p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The weighing means are arranged, with respect to the conveyor line, in such a way that the containers resting on the relative weighing supports partially engage the conveyor line, requiring that the conveyor line be halted for the whole weighing step. The position is close proximity of the weighing means with respect to the 
<!-- EPO <DP n="4"/>-->
 conveyor line is justified by the need to make the containers perform short and rapid runs, with the aim of minimising the time required for the weighing operations. </p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The above-described unit can be activated in order to perform a 100% or statistic weighing operation, with only the weighing times between a weighing mode and the other being different. </p><p id="p0010" num="0010">It is known that the accuracy of the weighing is connected to the weighing time; this is because of the inertia effect of the components of the weighing means etc. which cause an error in measurement which lasts for a time connected to the "settling" of the measuring device. </p><p id="p0011" num="0011">For elongate-type containers with a relatively small base in relation to the axial length thereof (for example vials or the like), however, the short and rapid runs they are subjected to during transfer towards and from the weighing means can cause their upturning, and thus their fall from a vertically-resting position. In a like case, the falling containers might interfere with mechanical parts in movement, compromising their functioning and/or even determining their breakage or clogging; the conveyor line in this case would have to be halted in order to remove the fallen containers; parts of machine might require sanitisation (sometimes immediate) if the containers were filled with product that tipped out onto them, fouling and even contaminating them. </p><p id="p0012" num="0012">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The aim of the present invention therefore consists in providing an apparatus and a method for weighing containers supplied along a conveyor line, which are also particularly suitable for weighing elongate containers. The above aims are attained with an apparatus according to claim 1 , and a method according to claim 11. in a preferred embodiment, an apparatus is provided for high-speed weighing of elongate containers supplied along a conveyor line, comprising: weighing means arranged laterally to a stretch of the container conveyor line; a support

 member suitable for restingly receiving at least a container; a first articulated system, comprising a first member, a second member hinged to the first member, a third member hinged to the first member and a fourth member which is hinged to the second member and the third member, the first articulated system being configured such as to impart a translating motion to the support member. The apparatus further comprises an articulated system comprising a connecting member, a fifth member hinged to the connecting member, a sixth member hinged to the connecting member and a seventh member which is hinged to the fifth member and the sixth member, the fifth member or the sixth member or the seventh member being connected to the support member, the second articulated system being configured such as to impart a rotary motion to the support member. The device is further configured and arranged with respect to the conveyor line such as to impress, by means of the first articulated system and the second articulated system, a translating and rotating motion to the support member between a first position, in which the support member is arranged at the stretch of the conveyor line such as to receive therefrom at least a containers, and a second position in which the support member engages with the weighing means in order to enable weighing of the at least a container by the weighing means. The rotation of the support member during the travel towards and from the weighing means can advantageously impart to the containers transported thereby an inclined disposition with respect to a vertical direction, which is stabler as each container can rest on the support member with a bottom thereof and also with a variably larger or smaller portion of lateral surface thereof. Even elongate containers can therefore be moved towards, and weighed by, weighing means without compromising the normal functioning of the conveyor line. </p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In an embodiment, the fifth member or the sixth member can be connected to the second member, or to the third member, so as to receive motion therefrom.

 In a preferred embodiment, a method for weighing containers supplied in a vertical position along a conveyor line and exhibiting a bottom and a body with a lateral surface is provided. The method comprises steps of collecting at least a container to be weighed from the conveyor line by means of a support member that is suitable for receiving the container; transferring the container to be weighed from the conveyor line towards weighing means; weighing the container using the weighing means; and transferring the weighed container from the weighing means towards the conveyor means. </p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The method further comprises, during the transfer steps from the conveyor line towards the weighing means and vice versa, imparting a roto-translating motion on the container. </p><p id="p0016" num="0016">During the roto-translation, the container inclines with respect to a vertical direction, such that the container contacts the support member and the weighing means with the bottom and with at least a portion of lateral surface thereof. </p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In particular, in a preferred embodiment, the method comprises supplying and collecting the containers in a vertical position along and from the conveyor line, and weighing the containers in an inclined position. </p><p id="p0018" num="0018">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Specific embodiments of the invention will be provided in the following description according to what is set out in the claims and with the aid of the accompanying tables of drawings, in which: figure 1 is a perspective and schematic view of the device of the present invention; figure 2 is a view from above of the device of figure 1 ; figures 3, 4 and 5 are lateral views, according to the arrow X1 of figure 1 , of the device of the invention, which represent, in greater detail and with greater precision, three different operating configurations of the device.

 DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In general terms, the apparatus (1) for weighing elongate containers (5) supplied along a conveyor line (4), object of the present invention, comprises: weighing means (2) arranged laterally to a stretch (3) of the container conveyor line (4); a support member (6) suitable for restingly receiving at least a container (5); a first articulated system (7), comprising a first member (9), a second member (9) hinged to the first member (8), a third member (10) hinged to the first member (8) and a fourth member (11) which is hinged to the second member (9) and the third member (10), the first articulated system (7) being configured such as to impart a translating motion to the support member (6); a second articulated system (12) comprising a connecting member (40), a fifth member (13) hinged to the connecting member (40), a sixth member (14) hinged to the fourth member (11) and a seventh member (15) which is hinged to the fifth member (13) and the sixth member (14), the fifth member (13) or the sixth member (14) or the seventh member (15) being connected to the support member (6), the second articulated system (12) being configured such as to impart a rotary motion to the support member. The device (1) is further configured and arranged with respect to the conveyor line (4) such as to impress, by means of the first articulated system (7) and the second articulated system (12), a translating and rotating motion to the support member (6) between a first position (K1), in which the support member (6) is arranged at the stretch (3) of the conveyor line (4) such as to receive therefrom at least a container (5), and a second position (K2) in which the support member (6) engages with the weighing means (2) in order to enable weighing of the at least a container (5) by the weighing means (2). </p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In the illustrated embodiment, the containers (5) are advantageously weighed in an inclined position with respect to a vertical direction. In the inclined position the containers (5) rest on the weighing means (2) by a bottom thereof and at least a portion of lateral surface thereof. The fifth member (13) or the sixth member (14) or the seventh member (15) can be connected to the second member (9) or the thjrd member (10) in order 
<!-- EPO <DP n="8"/>-->
 to receive motion therefrom. In this way, with a single activation a roto- translation of the support member (6) can be obtained; otherwise, a second activation can be used (and thus a separate motorisation) acting directly on the support member (6) or on the fifth member (13) or the sixth member (14) or the seventh member (15) such as to impart a rotary motion on the support member (6). </p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In more detail, an eighth member (16) can realise the connection, which eighth member (16) is hinged demountably directly to the support member (6) or the fifth member (13) or the sixth member (14) or the seventh member (15) on one side and is always hinged demountably to the second member (9) or the third member (10) on the other side. In the illustrated embodiment of the figures, the eighth member (16) is rod-shaped and is hinged demountably to the fifth member (13) on one side and to the second member (9) on the opposite side. </p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Elastic means (26) can be interposed between the second member (9) or the third member (10) on one side and between the support member (6) or the fifth member (13) or the sixth member (14) or the seventh member (15) on the other side; the elastic means (26), if included, are arranged and configured such as to facilitate the return of the support member (6) from the second position (K2) to the first position (K1). In more detail, the elastic means (26) can be hinged demountably, on the one side, to the second member (9) or to the third member (10) and can be hinged, again demountably, on the other side, to the fifth member (13) or the sixth member (14) or the seventh member (15). </p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The embodiment illustrated in the figures is now described, as a non-limiting example of the invention as described above, in general terms and claimed herein below. </p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The support member (6) comprises a base (35) for restingly receiving a bottom of the containers (5) to be weighed and a lateral wall (36) for contacting respective portions of lateral surfaces of the containers (5).
