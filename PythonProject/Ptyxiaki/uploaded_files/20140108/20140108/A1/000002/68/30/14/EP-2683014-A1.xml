More particularly, the present invention relates to a non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery with excellent safety and battery characteristics.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Conventionally, mainly nickel-cadmium batteries have been used as secondary batteries for memory-backup of AV and information devices, such as personal computers, VTRs, and the like, or as power sources for driving these devices. Because of their high voltage/energy concentration and excellent self-discharge characteristics, non-aqueous electrolyte secondary batteries have particularly been attracting attention as a replacement for nickel-cadmium batteries. As a result of various development efforts, some non-aqueous electrolyte secondary batteries have already been commercialized. Currently, more than half of notebook computers, cellular phones, and the like are driven by non-aqueous electrolyte secondary batteries, and there are high expectations for their use in the near future in environmental vehicles, of which electrical vehicles and hybrid vehicles are representative.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Carbon is often used as a negative electrode material in these non-aqueous electrolyte secondary batteries, and various organic solvents are used in the electrolytes in order to mitigate the risk when lithium is produced on the surface of the negative electrode, as well as to achieve a high driving voltage. Particularly in non-aqueous electrolyte secondary batteries for cameras, alkali metals (especially lithium metals or lithium alloys) and the like are used as the negative electrode material, and aprotic organic solvents<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> such as ester organic solvents are normally used in the electrolytes.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">As described above, non-aqueous electrolyte secondary batteries exhibit high performance but cannot be considered to exhibit sufficient safety. First, alkali metals (especially lithium metals, lithium alloys, and the like) that are used as negative electrode material for non-aqueous electrolyte secondary batteries have extremely high activity with respect to water. Therefore, when for example water enters through an imperfect seal in the battery, the negative electrode material and the water react yielding hydrogen, which poses the risk of ignition or the like. Furthermore, since lithium metal has a low melting point (about 170°C), an extremely dangerous situation may occur, such as the battery melting when a large current suddenly flows during a short circuit or the like, causing the battery to heat excessively. Moreover, the danger exists of the battery exploding or igniting due to gas that is generated upon the electrolytes evaporating or decomposing due to generation of heat in the battery. It has also been pointed out that the battery may be contaminated by minute scrap metal at the time of electrode composition, leading to a short circuit, abnormal heat generation, or ignition.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In order to solve the aforementioned problems, when temperature increases and pressure inside the battery rises during a short circuit or overcharge of a cylindrical battery, for example, a technique has been proposed to provide a mechanism in the battery whereby an excessive current of a predetermined amount or greater is prevented from flowing into the cylindrical battery by breaking electrode terminals at the same time as when a safety valve operates (see NPL 1). The mechanism does not necessarily operate normally, however, and when the mechanism does not operate normally, more heat is generated due to the excessive current, and thus the danger of ignition or the like still remains. Therefore, there is demand for the development of a non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery that fundamentally reduces the risk of electrolyte evaporation or decomposition, ignition, and the like without relying upon a safety mechanism such as a safety valve.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">A non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery that greatly reduces the danger of the battery igniting and burning in an emergency, such as a short circuit, has thus been developed by adding a phosphazene compound to the<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> non-aqueous electrolyte to make the non-aqueous electrolyte incombustible, flame retardant, or self-extinguishing (see PTL 1).</p><heading id="h0003">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h0004">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">PTL 1: <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO02021629A1"><text>WO 02/021629A1</text></patcit></p><heading id="h0005">Non-patent Literature</heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">NPL 1: <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Nikkan Kogyo Shinbun, "Electronic Technology", Vol. 39, No. 9, 1997</text></nplcit></p><heading id="h0006">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h0007">(Technical Problem)</heading><p id="p0009" num="0009">In recent years, however, there has been demand for further improvement in the safety and battery characteristics of non-aqueous electrolyte secondary batteries, and the non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery disclosed in PTL 1 now has room for further improvement.

The non-aqueous electrolyte additive according to the present invention includes the phosphazene compound represented by the above general formula (1) and the borate or phosphate selected from the second compound group.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The aprotic organic solvent-based non-aqueous electrolytes conventionally used in a non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery are a flammable liquid. When a large current rapidly flows, such as during a short circuit, and the battery generates an abnormal amount of heat, the electrolytes may evaporate or decompose to generate gas, and the generated gas may be ignited by a spark produced by the short circuit or the like, causing the battery to explode or ignite. Such electrolytes are thus highly dangerous. The addition of the non-aqueous electrolyte additive according to the present invention, which includes the above phosphazene compound, to these conventional non-aqueous electrolytes makes the non-aqueous electrolytes self-extinguishing, flame retardant, or incombustible due to action of nitrogen gas and fluorine gas derived from the phosphazene compound. Accordingly, the safety of the battery using the non-aqueous electrolyte that includes the additive according to the present invention is greatly improved. Furthermore, phosphorus contained in the above phosphazene compound acts to suppress chain-decomposition of high polymer materials that form a part of the battery, thereby increasing flame resistance (self-extinguishing property, flame retardancy, and incombustibility) even more effectively. Note that the aforementioned "safety" can be evaluated by the following safety evaluation method.</p><heading id="h0012">«Safety Evaluation Method»</heading><p id="p0024" num="0024">Safety is evaluated according to a method that is a modification to the UL94HB method of the UL (Underwriting Laboratory) standards. The combustion behavior of flame (test flame: 800°C, for 30 seconds) that ignites in an atmospheric environment is measured. Specifically, on the basis of UL test standards, incombustible quartz fiber is saturated with 1.0 mL of electrolyte. Test pieces measuring 127 mm by 12.7 mm are prepared, and<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> evaluation can be made by observing the ignitability (flame height and the like), combustibility, formation of carbide, phenomenon during secondary ignition, and the like of the test pieces.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In a conventional non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery, it is considered that compounds generated due to decomposition or reaction of the solvent or the supporting salt in the non-aqueous electrolyte causes electrodes and peripheral materials of the electrodes to corrode. It is also considered that a reduction in the supporting salt itself further worsens the performance of the battery. For example, in ester-based electrolytes used as electrolytes in a non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery, it is considered that corrosion progresses causing the battery to deteriorate due to PF<sub>5</sub> gas generated when a lithium ion source, such as an LiPF<sub>6</sub> salt that is a supporting salt, or the like decomposes over time into LiF and PF<sub>5</sub>, or due to a hydrogen fluoride gas or the like that is generated when the PF<sub>5</sub> gas further reacts with water or the like. A phenomenon thus occurs in which not only does conductivity of the non-aqueous electrolyte deteriorate, but the electrode materials also deteriorate due to the generation of the hydrogen fluoride gas. On the other hand, the above phosphazene compound contributes to suppressing decomposition of the solvent or supporting salt, for example a lithium ion source such as LiPF<sub>6</sub>, and promotes stabilization (being particularly effective for PF<sub>6</sub>). Accordingly, the addition of the phosphazene compound to a conventional non-aqueous electrolyte suppresses the decomposition reaction of the non-aqueous electrolyte, thus allowing for prevention of corrosion and deterioration.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Furthermore, the borate or phosphate selected from the second compound group has the effect of trapping water and hydrogen fluoride, which are one reason for acceleration of decomposition of the electrolyte. Therefore, the addition of the borate or phosphate to a conventional non-aqueous electrolyte more reliably suppresses the decomposition reaction of the non-aqueous electrolyte, thus allowing for more reliable prevention of corrosion and deterioration. Furthermore, when using a non-aqueous electrolyte to which the borate or phosphate has been added in a battery, the borate or phosphate decomposes on the positive electrode and the negative electrode to form a protective film that can conduct only lithium ions.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> Therefore, an effect is achieved to suppress deterioration and an increase in battery internal resistance which are normally caused by solvent or electrolyte decomposing on the surface of the positive or negative electrode. It is thus possible to enhance the battery life and to improve the characteristics at a low temperature.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The above phosphazene compound is represented by the above general formula (1), wherein each R independently represents fluorine or a substituent including an organic group substituted with fluorine, at least one of the Rs represents the substituent including an organic group substituted with fluorine, and n is from 3 to 14.
