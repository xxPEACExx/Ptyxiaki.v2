Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to an endoscope system that obtains information about blood such as an oxygen saturation level of blood, a processor device of the endoscope system, and a method for controlling the endoscope system.</p><heading id="h0003">2. Description Related to the Prior Art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">In a medical field, an endoscope system is used often for diagnosis and treatment. The endoscope system is constituted of an electronic endoscope to be inserted into a human body cavity, a light source device for supplying illumination light to the electronic endoscope, and a processor device that processes an image signal produced by the electronic endoscope and displays a processed image on a monitor. There is known an endoscope system that carries out not only normal observation for imaging an internal body portion under irradiation with white light (normal light), but also special observation for imaging the internal body portion under irradiation with specific narrow band light (special light).</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">As the special observation, an oxygen saturation level obtaining technique is known using first light being narrow band light having a wavelength range in which an absorption coefficient is different between oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin, and second light having a wavelength range different from that of the first light. The first and second light is applied sequentially to the internal body portion in order to determine an oxygen saturation level of blood. The determined oxygen saturation level is reflected in a normal image obtained in the normal observation, to produce a special image in which a hypoxic region<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> being a cancer-suspected lesion is colored artificially.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The normal image mainly aims to look at details of mucosal structure, including blood vessels, projections and depressions, and the like. Thus, the normal image requires high resolution. In the special image, on the other hand, the hypoxic region extends a certain size, so the high resolution is not required. However, the special image requires high sensitivity to reflected light, because the oxygen saturation level is calculated from the light amount of the first and second light reflected from the internal body portion. For this reason, high-intensity narrow band light emitted from an LD, LED, or light source rivaling the LD or LED is needed as the first and second light. In the case of not using the high-intensity narrow band light, a high-sensitivity image sensor becomes necessary.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Accordingly, <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US20100245551A"><text>US Patent Application Publication No. 2010/0245551</text></patcit> discloses an endoscope system that is provided with two image sensors i.e. a normal image sensor having normal sensitivity and a high-sensitivity image sensor having high sensitivity. In this system, the normal image sensor is used in the normal observation requiring high resolution, while the high-sensitivity image sensor is used in the special observation requiring high sensitivity.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In the <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US20100245551A"><text>US Patent Application Publication No. 2010/0245551</text></patcit>, the high-sensitivity image sensor is used for detecting weak autofluorescence distributed through a wide wavelength range. On the other hand, the first and second light used for calculation of the oxygen saturation level has the specific wavelength ranges, so the light amount of the first and second light is not as low as that of the autofluorescence, though is lower than that of the white light. Therefore, in a short-distance view in which a distal end portion of the electronic endoscope is near the body portion, even the normal sensor can detect an enough light amount<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> to calculate the oxygen saturation level. When the normal sensor is adequate, it is desirable to use the normal image sensor having high resolution, instead of the high-sensitivity image sensor.</p><heading id="h0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">An object of the present invention is to provide an endoscope system that can produce a special image having as high resolution as possible, while securing sensitivity required for calculating an oxygen saturation level of blood, a processor device of the endoscope system, and a method for controlling the endoscope system.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">To achieve the above and other objects, an endoscope system according to the present invention includes a lighting means, an imaging means, a light amount measurement means, an imaging control means, and a special image processing means. The lighting means applies special illumination light to a body portion. The special illumination light has a wavelength at which oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin have different absorption coefficients. The imaging means has a normal image sensor and a high-sensitivity image sensor. The imaging means captures an image of the body portion irradiated with the special illumination light. The light amount measurement means measures a reflected light amount of the special illumination light based on a signal obtained by the imaging means. The imaging control means changes operating conditions of the normal and high-sensitivity image sensors in accordance with the reflected light amount. The special image processing means produces a special image depicting an oxygen saturation level of blood based on the signal obtained by the imaging means under control of the imaging control means.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The imaging control means preferably chooses which one of the normal and high-sensitivity image sensors to use for imaging the body portion irradiated with the special illumination light<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> in accordance with the reflected light amount of the special illumination light. The special image processing means preferably produces the special image based on a signal obtained by selected one of the normal and high-sensitivity image sensors.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The light amount measurement means preferably measures the reflected light amount of the special illumination light repeatedly in certain cycles. The imaging control means preferably chooses which one of the normal and high-sensitivity image sensors to use based on the reflected light amount. When the normal image sensor is used, the imaging control means preferably stops using the normal image sensor and starts using the high-sensitivity image sensor, if the reflected light amount is less than a first sensor selection threshold value. When the high-sensitivity image sensor is used, the imaging control means preferably stops using the high-sensitivity image sensor and starts using the normal image sensor, if the reflected light amount is more than a second sensor selection threshold value. The second sensor selection threshold value is preferably larger than the first sensor selection threshold value.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The lighting means may sequentially apply to the body portion the special illumination light and normal illumination light having a broad wavelength band. The normal illumination light is used for producing a normal image. When the reflected light amount of the special illumination light is low, the imaging control means preferably controls the normal and high-sensitivity image sensors such that the normal image sensor captures the image under irradiation with the normal illumination light, and the high-sensitivity image sensor captures the image under irradiation with the special illumination light. When the reflected light amount of the special illumination light is not low, the imaging control means preferably controls the normal and high-sensitivity image sensors such that the normal image sensor<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> captures the image under irradiation with the normal illumination light and the special illumination light.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The normal illumination light may include red light, green light, and blue light. The special illumination light may include at least blue narrow band light having a wavelength at which oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin have different absorption coefficients. The lighting means may selectively emit the red light, the green light, the blue light, and the blue narrow band light.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The normal illumination light may be first emission light including first blue narrow band light and fluorescence obtained by wavelength conversion of the first blue narrow band light by a wavelength conversion element. The special illumination light may be second emission light including second blue narrow band light and fluorescence obtained by wavelength conversion of the second blue narrow band light by the wavelength conversion element. The lighting means may selectively emit the first and second emission light.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The sensitivity of the high-sensitivity image sensor is preferably 2 to 200 times that of the normal image sensor.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">When the reflected light amount of the special illumination light is low, the normal image sensor preferably captures the image under irradiation with the normal illumination light and outputs a color normal signal, and the high-sensitivity image sensor preferably captures the image under irradiation with the special illumination light and outputs a special signal. The special image processing means preferably produces the special image based on the special signal and a specific color signal of the color normal signal.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">When the reflected light amount of the special illumination light is not low, the normal image sensor preferably captures the image under irradiation with the normal illumination light and<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> outputs the color normal signal, and captures the image under irradiation with the special illumination light and outputs the special signal. The special image processing means preferably produces the special image based on the special signal and the specific color signal of the color normal signal.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The endoscope system may further include a beam splitter for splitting the special illumination light reflected from the body portion into two beams. One of the two beams is incident upon the normal image sensor. The other of the two beams is incident upon the high-sensitivity image sensor. When a first optical path between the beam splitter and the normal image sensor is not equivalent with a second optical path between the beam splitter and the high-sensitivity image sensor, an effective area is preferably defined in each of the normal and high-sensitivity image sensors in such a position as to correspond to an overlapping area in which object images obtained by the normal and high-sensitivity image sensors overlap each other.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">A processor device of an endoscope system includes a light amount measurement means, an imaging control means, and a special image processing means. The light amount measurement means measures a reflected light amount of the special illumination light based on a signal obtained by the imaging means. The imaging control means changes operating conditions of the normal and high-sensitivity image sensors in accordance with the reflected light amount. The special image processing means produces a special image depicting an oxygen saturation level of blood based on the signal obtained by the imaging means under control of the imaging control means.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">A method for controlling an endoscope system includes the steps of applying special illumination light to a body portion; guiding the special illumination light reflected from the body portion to an imaging means; measuring a reflected light amount<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> of the special illumination light based on a signal obtained by the imaging means; changing operating conditions of the normal and high-sensitivity image sensors in accordance with the measured reflected light amount; operating the normal and high-sensitivity image sensors in the changed operating conditions, and imaging the body portion under irradiation with the special illumination light; and producing a special image depicting an oxygen saturation level of blood based on an image signal obtained by the normal or high-sensitivity image sensor.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">According to the present invention, the operating conditions of the normal and high-sensitivity image sensors are changed in accordance with the reflected light amount of the special illumination light. For example, when the reflected light amount is low, the high-sensitivity image sensor is used to obtain a signal having adequate intensity for calculating the oxygen saturation level. When the reflected light amount is not low, on the other hand, the normal image sensor is used to obtain a high resolution image. Therefore, it is possible to produce the special image having as high resolution as possible, while securing sensitivity required for calculating the oxygen saturation level.</p><heading id="h0005">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0021" num="0021">For more complete understanding of the present invention, and the advantage thereof, reference is now made to the subsequent descriptions taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:

The illumination light is applied to the internal body portion through the lighting windows 22. The imaging window 23 allows the light reflected from the body portion to pass through. The air/water feeding nozzles feed air and water to clean the imaging window 23. From the forceps outlet port, a medical<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> instrument such as a forceps and an electric knife is projected.

The steering assembly 20 is bent flexibly in an arbitrary direction in response to operation of an angle knob 26 provided on the control handle unit 16. The bend of the steering assembly 20 aims the head assembly 19 at a desired direction. The elongated tube 21 is flexible so as to be inserted into a serpentine canal such as esophagus and intestine. Through the insert section 17, a communication cable and a light guide 43 (see <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>) are disposed. The communication cable is used for establishing communication with the normal imaging unit 47 and the high-sensitivity imaging unit 49.

The universal cord 18 has at its distal end a multi connector 28 having a communication connector and a light source connector. The communication connector contains an end of the communication cable.

The light source 30a, being composed of a xenon lamp, a halogen lamp, a metal halide lamp, or the like, emits broad band light BB (see <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref>) having a wavelength band of 400 to 700 nm. The aperture stop 30b is driven by the MPU 70 of the processor device 12 to control the light amount of the broad band light BB.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The motor 32 rotates the rotary filter 31 about a rotary shaft 31a. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, the rotary filter 31 is provided with an inner radial portion 35 that is near the rotary shaft 31a and an outer radial portion 37 that is far from the rotary shaft 31a. The shifter 33 shifts the rotary filter 31 in a radial direction. Thus, in the normal mode, the rotary filter 31 is shifted to an inner position in which the inner radial portion 35 is disposed in an optical path of the broad band light BB. In the special mode, the rotary filter 31 is shifted to an outer position in which the outer radial portion 37 is disposed in the optical path of the broad band light BB.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In the inner radial portion 35, an NR filter 40r, an NG filter 40g, an NB filter 40b are formed in its circumferential direction. A light shielding portion is formed between the NR filter 40r and the NG filter 40g, between the NG filter 40g and the NB filter 40b, and between the NB filter 40b and the NR filter 40r to block the broad band light BB. The outer radial portion 37 is provided with six filters, i.e. an NR filter 40r, an SR filter 42r, an NG filter 40g, an SG filter 42g, an NB filter 40b, and an SB filter 42b disposed in its circumferential direction. A light shielding portion is formed between two of the filters 40r, 42r, 40g, 42g, 40b, and 42b adjoining each other to block the broad band light BB.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref>, the NR filter 40r, the NG filter 40g, and the NB filter 40b transmit red band light, green band light, and blue band light, which are required for producing a normal<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> image, respectively, out of the broad band light BB. The NR filter 40r transmits normal red light (NR light) having a wavelength band of 580 to 760 nm out of the broad band light BB. The NG filter 40g transmits normal green light (NG light) having a wavelength band of 450 to 630 nm.

There is provided a certain light shielding period between individual applications of the light. The NR, NG, and NB light enters the light guide 43 through a condenser lens 38 and a rod integrator 39.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">In the special mode, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 5B</figref>, by the rotation of the rotary filter 31 set in the outer position, the NR, SR, NG, SG, NB, and SB light is applied in this order to the internal body portion. There is provided a certain light shielding period between individual applications of the light. The NR, SR, NG, SG, NB, and SB light enters the light guide 43 through the condenser lens 38 and the rod integrator 39.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 6</figref>, in a wavelength band of 473±10 nm of the SB light, oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) has a higher absorption coefficient than deoxyhemoglobin (Hb). For this reason, when the<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> SB light is applied to the blood vessel, the intensity of the reflected SB light decreases with increase in the oxygen saturation level of blood. In other words, the higher the oxygen saturation level, the darker the blood vessel is seen. Note that, the transmission wavelength bands of the SR filter 42r and the SG filter 42g may be narrowed, as with that of the SB filter 42b. Also in this case, the oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) has a higher absorption coefficient than the deoxyhemoglobin (Hb) in the transmission wavelength bands of the SR filter 42r and the SG filter 42g.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, the electronic endoscope 11 is provided with the light guide 43, a beam splitter 45, a normal imaging unit 47, and a high-sensitivity imaging unit 49. The light guide 43 is made of a large-diameter optical fiber, a fiber bundle, or the like. By the connection of the multi connector 28 to the light source device 13, a light incident end of the light guide 43 is opposed to a light exit end of the rod integrator 39 of the light source device 13.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">A lighting lens 48 for regulating a light distribution angle of the illumination light is disposed in front of each lighting window 22. The illumination light transmitted through the light guide 43 is applied to the internal body portion through the lighting windows 22. The light reflected from the body portion is incident upon an image-forming lens 51 through the imaging window 23. The light exits from the image-forming lens 51, and is separated into two beams by the beam splitter 45. The beam splitter 45 is composed of a prism 52, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 7</figref>. The prism 52 has a beam splitting surface 52a to split the incident light. One of the two beams split by the beam splitting surface 52a is incident upon a monochrome normal image sensor 53 of the normal imaging unit 47, while the other one is incident upon a monochrome high-sensitivity image sensor 60 of the<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> high-sensitivity imaging unit 49. The image-forming lens 51, the prism 52, the normal imaging unit 47, and the high-sensitivity imaging unit 49 compose an imaging section.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The normal imaging unit 47 includes the monochrome normal image sensor 53 and an AFE 55. The MPU 70 controls the operation of the normal imaging unit 47. The normal image sensor 53 is a FT (frame transfer), FIT (frame interline transfer), or IT (interline transfer) type CCD image sensor having a frame rate of 30 or 60 f/s, for example. The normal image sensor 53 has a light receiving surface 56 upon which the light is incident from the prism 52. The light receiving surface 56 has a matrix of pixels. Each pixel, being made of a photoelectric conversion element such as a photodiode, performs photoelectric conversion of received light and accumulates signal charge by an amount corresponding to the amount of the received light. The signal charge is read out on a pixel-by-pixel basis, and transmitted to the AFE 55 as an image signal. Note that, the rotary filter 31 necessarily has the light shielding portions in the case of using the FT type CCD image sensor, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>, but may not have the light shielding portions in the case of using the FIT or IT type CCD image sensor.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">A Peltier element 58 is provided on the normal image sensor 53 on a side opposite to the light receiving surface 56. The Peltier element 58 dissipates heat produced by the normal image sensor 53 to cool the normal image sensor 53. Cooling the normal image sensor 53 contributes to reduction in dark current, which occurs in a dark area 56c of the light receiving surface 56. The dark area 56c is an area that receives no reflected light, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 8</figref>. Thus, the ratio of output from a light receiving area 56a, which receives the reflected light, to the image signal is increased, and hence the sensitivity of the normal image sensor 53 is improved. For example, a reduction of 8°C in temperature<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> of the normal image sensor 53 doubles the sensitivity. Note that, the Peltier element 58 is not necessarily provided on the normal image sensor 53.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The AFE 55 includes a CDS-ADC 55a having a correlated double sampling circuit and an analog-to-digital converter, and a TG (timing generator) 55b. The CDS-ADC 55a applies correlated double sampling processing to the image signal outputted from the normal image sensor 53, to remove noise from the image signal. After the noise removal, the image signal is converted into a digital image signal of a predetermined bit number, and inputted to a DSP 72 of the processor device 13. The TG 55b generates a drive signal to control drive of the normal image sensor 53 such as imaging timing.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The high-sensitivity imaging unit 49 has a monochrome high-sensitivity image sensor 60 and an AFE 55, and is driven by the MPU 70 as with the normal imaging unit 47. The MPU 70 functions as an imaging control means, which changes operating conditions of the normal imaging unit 47 and the high-sensitivity imaging unit 49. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 11</figref>, the high-sensitivity image sensor 60 has a light receiving surface 62 upon which the light is incident from the prism 52. The light receiving surface 62 has a matrix of pixels. As with the normal image sensor 53, the high-sensitivity image sensor 60 performs photoelectric conversion of received light at its light receiving surface 62, and reads out an image signal obtained thereby. The read image signal is transmitted to the AFE 55. The AFE 55 of the high-sensitivity imaging unit 49 has the same function as that of the AFE 55 of the normal imaging unit 47. The image signal after being processed by the AFE 55 is inputted to a DSP 73 of the processor device 13.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The pixel of the high-sensitivity image sensor 60 is composed of an avalanche photodiode, for example. Thus, the<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> high-sensitivity image sensor 60 has higher sensitivity than the normal image sensor 53 owing to an avalanche multiplication effect. For example, the sensitivity of the high-sensitivity image sensor 60 is 2 to 200 times as much as that of the normal image sensor 53. In other words, the sensitivity ratio between the normal image sensor 53 and the high-sensitivity image sensor 60 is on the order of 1:200 at the maximum.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The high-sensitivity image sensor 60 needs cooling to take full advantage of the avalanche multiplication effect. Thus, a Peltier element 58 is provided on the high-sensitivity image sensor 60 on a side opposite to the light receiving surface 62. The Peltier element 58 dissipates heat produced by the high-sensitivity image sensor 60 to cool the high-sensitivity image sensor 60. The high-sensitivity image sensor 60 that is cooled to 40°C using the Peltier element 58 has sensitivity approximately 32 times as much as the high-sensitivity image sensor 60 without being cooled.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">As with the normal image sensor 53, the high-sensitivity image sensor 60 is an FT, FIT, or IT type CCD image sensor. This high-sensitivity image sensor 60 operates at a frame rate lower than that of the normal image sensor 53. For example, when the normal image sensor 53 has a frame rate of 30 f/s, the high-sensitivity image sensor 60 may have a frame rate of 15 f/s or 7.5 f/s. Reducing the frame rate allows to elongate charge accumulation time, and hence increase the amount of light taken in the high-sensitivity image sensor 60. In addition to elongating the charge accumulation time, cooling the high-sensitivity image sensor 60 using the Peltier element 58 or the like can improve an S/N ratio. The high-sensitivity image sensor 60 has a total pixel number of "1/n<sup>2</sup>" and sensitivity of "n<sup>2</sup>", with respect to the normal image sensor 53.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The normal image sensor 53 and the high-sensitivity image<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> sensor 60 may have the same or different pixel number. The pixels of the normal image sensor 53 and the high-sensitivity image sensor 60 may be rectangular or in another form. The normal image sensor 53 and the high-sensitivity image sensor 60 have the same or different aspect ratio (length-to-width ratio).</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">The normal image sensor 53 and the high-sensitivity image sensor 60 have to be laid out such that an object image formed on the light receiving surface 56 of the normal image sensor 53 and an object image formed on the light receiving surface 62 of the high-sensitivity image sensor 60 become almost equal. Thus, it is preferable to approximately equalize an optical path of light exiting from the beam splitter 45 and entering the normal image sensor 53 with an optical path of light exiting from the beam splitter 45 and entering the high-sensitivity image sensor 60.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">However, if the optical paths are not equalized, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 12</figref>, an object image 57 obtained by the normal image sensor 53 partly differs from an object image 59 obtained by the high-sensitivity image sensor 60. An overlapping area 61 is determined by AND operation of the object images 57 and 59. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">Fig. 8</figref>, in the light receiving surface 56 of the normal image sensor 53, a portion corresponding to the overlapping area 61 is referred to as an effective area 56b of the light receiving area 56a, which captures the reflected light and forms the object image 57. Likewise, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">Fig. 11</figref>, in the light receiving surface 62 of the high-sensitivity image sensor 60, a portion corresponding to the overlapping area 61 is referred to as an effective area 62b of the light receiving area 62a, which forms the object image 59. These effective areas 56b and 62b are preferably determined by checking the object image 57 outputted from the normal image sensor 53 and the object image 59 outputted from the high-sensitivity image sensor 60 on the monitor 14 after<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> registration of the optical systems including the beam splitter 45. In a case where the high-sensitivity image sensor 60 has lower resolution than the normal image sensor 53, the length of the optical path of the high-sensitivity image sensor 60 may be slightly elongated because the high-sensitivity image sensor 60 does not need high sharpness.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">Fig. 2</figref>, the processor device 12 includes the MPU 70, the DSPs 72 and 73, and a processor 75. The MPU 70 controls the operation of the electronic endoscope 11 and the light source device 13, in addition to the operation of the processor device 12. The MPU 70 has a control program memory 70a for storing various control programs and setup data. The control program written for observation of the oxygen saturation level is loaded from the control program memory 70a and executed to carry out various control operations. Note that, the control program memory 70a is rewritable. Instead of or in addition to the control program written for observation of the oxygen saturation level, for example, a control program for AFI (autofluorescence imaging) may be installed. Note that, an image signal outputted from the effective area 56b, 62b of the normal or high-sensitivity image sensor 53, 60 is used for producing the normal or special image. An image signal outputted from an area other than the effective area 56b, 62b is unused for producing the normal or special image.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">The DSP 72 obtains the image signal outputted from the normal imaging unit 47. The DSP 72 applies signal processing including gamma correction and white balance correction to the image signal, to produce a normal-sensor image. The normal-sensor image includes first and second normal-sensor images. The first normal-sensor image is produced from NR, NG, and NB signals obtained by the normal image sensor 53 under irradiation with the NR, NG, and NB light. The second normal-sensor image is produced from SR, SG, and SB signals obtained by the normal image sensor<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> 53 under irradiation with the SR, SG, and SB light. The first and second normal-sensor images are transmitted to the processor 75. The DSP 73 performs similar processing and produces a high-sensitivity-sensor image. The high-sensitivity-sensor image is produced from SR, SG, and SB signals obtained by the high-sensitivity image sensor 60 under irradiation with the SR, SG, and SB light. The produced high-sensitivity-sensor image is transmitted to the processor 75.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">The DSPs 72 and 73 apply a pixel number conversion process to the first and second normal-sensor images and the high-sensitivity-sensor image. The pixel number conversion process converts a pixel pitch of the first and second normal-sensor images and the high-sensitivity-sensor image by using a spline function and the like. When the effective area 56b of the normal image sensor 53 has a pixel number of "n1×m1" and the effective area 62b of the high-sensitivity image sensor 60 has a pixel number of "n2xm2", the pixel number of a part of every image corresponding to the effective area 56b or 62b is converted into "nxm" by the pixel number conversion process. "nxm" may be equal to "n1×m1", "n2xm2", or a default value. The aspect ratio of a pixel is preferably the same between before and after the pixel number conversion process, but may be different. Even if the aspect ratio of the pixel is different, a part of every image corresponding to the effective area 56b or 62b has the same angle of view between before and after the pixel number conversion process.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">The processor 75 includes a light amount evaluation section 78, a normal image processing section 79, and a special image processing section 80.

Then, the light amount evaluation section 78 judges whether or not the measured light amount is enough to calculate the oxygen saturation level, in other words, whether or not the measured light amount is not low. Out of the special illumination light, the amount of reflected light of only the SB light may be measured to judge whether or not the measured light amount is not low.

At this time, an amplification factor has to be taken into consideration as for the high-sensitivity-sensor image. The larger the average pixel value, the larger the reflected light amount. The light amount evaluation section 78 compares the average pixel value with a predetermined sensor selection threshold value, to judge whether or not the reflected light amount is not low. Note that, the sensor selection threshold value is preferably set at 1/50 of the maximum sensitivity of the normal image sensor 53.

As the binning process, hardware binning is adopted in which pixel addition is performed within the high-sensitivity image sensor 60, but software binning may be adopted instead in which outputted signals are subjected to the pixel addition. In the hardware binning, a drive signal for driving the high-sensitivity image sensor 60 is modified. In the binning process, the pixel area obtained by the pixel addition does not necessarily have the same number of pixels between its length and width directions. For example, the pixel area may have two pixels in the length direction and one pixel in the width direction, or four pixels in the length direction and one pixel in the width direction.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">Whether or not to perform the binning process is determined based on the reflected light amount of the special illumination light.

The binning stop threshold value is preferably larger than the binning start threshold value. For example, the binning stop threshold value is set at "(binning start threshold value)×16+10". If the difference between the binning start and stop threshold values is small, switching between performing and not performing the binning process occurs too often.

The intensity ratio calculator 82 calculates the intensity ratios B/G and R/G on a pixel-by-pixel basis by using the intensity of the pixel situated in the same position in the B and G images and in the R and G images.

The position and shape of the contour lines are determined by physical simulation of light scattering, and variable in accordance with blood volume.

However, the B image including a wavelength component of 473 nm is highly dependent not only on the oxygen saturation level but also on the blood volume. Thus, the use of the R image, which corresponds to light mainly dependent on the blood volume, and the G image, which is a reference image (standardization signal) of the B and R images, in addition to the B image, allows the<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> obtainment of the oxygen saturation level with high accuracy with eliminating the influence of the blood volume.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0011">Fig. 17</figref>, the intensity ratio B/G increases with increase in the intensity ratio R/G.

The blood volume increases with increase in the intensity ratio R/G due to the correlation therebetween. Out of the B, G, and R images, a signal value of the G image decreases most greatly with increase in the blood volume, and a signal value of the B image decreases next greatly. This is because the absorption coefficient is higher at a wavelength band of 540 to 580 nm included in the G image than that at a wavelength band of around 470 nm included in the B image (see <figref idrefs="f0004">Fig. 6</figref>).

The laser beams N1 and N2 are led to a combiner 106 through optical fibers 104. The combiner 106, being an optical element having the function of combining light beams transmitted through the optical fibers 104, combines optical axes of light beams that are incident selectively from the optical fibers 104 into one.

Also, the phosphor 98 is excited by the laser beam N2, and emits fluorescence FL2 having a wavelength band ranging from the green region to the red region. The fluorescence FL2 has slightly less intensity than the fluorescence FL1. Mixture of the fluorescence FL2 and the laser beam N2 transmitted through the phosphor 98 produces special illumination light. The type of the phosphor 98 is not specifically limited, as long as the phosphor is excited by blue excitation light and emits fluorescence having a wavelength band ranging from the green region to the red region.

As in the case of the first embodiment, when the reflected light amount of the special illumination light is not low, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0022">Fig. 34A</figref>, only the normal image sensor 110 is used. The normal image sensor 110 captures images of the internal body portion irradiated with the normal illumination light and the special illumination light. The normal image sensor 110 performs imaging operation and readout operation of an image signal in each emission period of the normal and special illumination light. Although it is not illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0022">Fig. 34A</figref>, in a period between the emission period of the normal illumination light and the emission period of the special illumination light, the electronic shutter is actuated to discharge (reset) electric charge accumulated in the normal image sensor 110. Thus, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0022">Fig. 34B</figref>, the normal image sensor 110 outputs NR, NG, and NB signals in the emission period of the normal illumination light, and SR, SG, and SB signals in the emission period of the special illumination light.</p><p id="p0106" num="0106">When the reflected light amount of the special illumination light is low, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0023">Fig. 35A</figref>, not only the normal image sensor 110 but also the high-sensitivity image sensor 112 is used.

The high-sensitivity image sensor 112 performs the imaging operation and the readout operation in the emission period of the special illumination light. Therefore, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0023">Fig. 35B</figref>, the normal image sensor 110 outputs the NR, NG, and NB signals, and the high-sensitivity image sensor 112 outputs the SR, SG, and SB signals.</p><p id="p0107" num="0107">Note that, the normal and special illumination light is produced by mixture of the fluorescence and the blue laser beam in the light source device 100.

For example, in the case of connecting an AFI endoscope, which is provided with the high-sensitivity image sensor having an excitation light barrier filter, to the processor device 12 and the light source device 13, it is preferable to use light that is in a transmission wavelength band (for example, 500 to 630 nm) of the barrier filter and has a wavelength (for example, 560±10 nm) at which the absorption coefficient is different between oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin.</p><p id="p0109" num="0109">In the above embodiments, the oxygen saturation level independent from the blood volume is calculated using the SB signal having a narrow band component of 473 nm, the SG signal having a green broad band component, and the SR signal having a<!-- EPO <DP n="43"> --> red broad band component. However, the oxygen saturation level independent from the depth of the blood vessel may be calculated using a first SB signal having a narrow band component of 445 nm, a second SB signal having a narrow band component of 473 nm, and a third SB signal having a narrow band component of 405 nm. In such a case, the SG filter 42g provided in the outer radial portion 37 of the rotary filter 31 is replaced with a filter transmitting narrow band light of 445±10 nm, and the SR filter 42r is replaced with a filter transmitting narrow band light of 405±10 nm.</p><p id="p0110" num="0110">To calculate the oxygen saturation level that is independent from the depth of the blood vessel, the correlation between the depth of the blood vessel and the oxygen saturation level, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0024">Fig. 36</figref>, is used. In <figref idrefs="f0024">Fig. 36</figref>, a luminance coordinate system 120 is an XY coordinate system having two axes of X and Y. A first intensity ratio S1/S3 between the first and third SB signals is assigned to the X axis. A second intensity ratio S2/S3 between the second and third SB signals is assigned to the Y axis. A blood information coordinate system 121 provided on the luminance coordinate system 120 is a UV coordinate system having two axes of U and V. The depth D of the blood vessel is assigned to the U axis. The oxygen saturation level StO2 is assigned to the V axis.</p><p id="p0111" num="0111">Since the depth of the blood vessel increases with increase in the first and second intensity ratios S1/S3 and S2/S3, the U axis has a positive gradient to the luminance coordinate system 120.

On the other hand, since the oxygen saturation level decreases with increase in the first and second intensity ratios S1/S3 and S2/S3, the V axis has a negative gradient to the luminance coordinate system 120. With respect to the V axis, an upper left direction indicates<!-- EPO <DP n="44"> --> that the oxygen saturation level StO2 is low, while a lower right direction indicates that the oxygen saturation level StO2 is high. In the blood information coordinate system 121, the U and V axes intersect with each other at right angles at an intersection point P.</p><p id="p0112" num="0112">To actually calculate the oxygen saturation level, the first intensity ratio S1*/S3* between the first and third SB signals obtained by imaging the body portion, and the second intensity ratio S2*/S3* between the second and third SB signals are calculated. Then, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0024">Fig. 37</figref>, coordinates Q (X*, Y*) corresponding to the first and second intensity ratios S1*/S3* and S2*/S3* are plotted on the luminance coordinate system 120. The coordinates Q are projected to each of the V axis representing the oxygen saturation level and the U axis representing the depth of the blood vessel, so the coordinates Q (U*, V*) are determined. Accordingly, "U*" being blood vessel depth information and "V*" being oxygen saturation level information of one pixel are obtained. Such a process is performed in order to obtain the blood vessel depth information and the oxygen saturation level information of all the pixels in a screen.
