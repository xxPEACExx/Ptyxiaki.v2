The belt reel comprises a belt retraction brake adapted to limit the retraction speed during retraction of the belt. The present invention also relates to a method for limiting the retraction speed of a belt reel during retraction of a belt onto the belt reel.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Seat belts, sometimes referred to as safety belts, in vehicles have significantly reduced the probability of injuries during collisions or other incidents. The belt itself is generally wounded up about a reel, generally referred to as a belt reel. A belt reel of conventional type comprises a retraction mechanism to retract the belt from an extracted position. One extracted position is a buckled position, e.g. the position a driver of the vehicle has when being position behind the steering wheel and buckled up.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">When the belt reel retracts the belt, the belt with its buckle runs the risk of either being retracted too slow or too fast. Is retracted too slow, the belt can be caught between the vehicle body and its door which might damage the belt. If the buckle is caught between the door and the vehicle body, the buckle could break or damage the lacquer of the vehicle body. Should the belt reel retract the belt too fast, the buckle runs the risk of smashing into the interior panels of the vehicle and damage the interior panel. It has been noticed that a belt retraction speed approximately &gt;3.0 m/s can damage the interior panels of the vehicle if hit by the buckle. Even if the impact of the buckle on the interior panel does not destroy the interior panel, it leaves ugly marks which can reduce the value of the vehicle. Providing a controlled belt retraction is thus a problem which needs to be addressed.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In the published UK patent application no. <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="GB2319502A"><text>GB 2,319,502 A</text></patcit>, a retractor assembly is disclosed. The retractor assembly comprises a two curved brake shoes arranged at a<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> distance. The belt travels between the two brake shoes during the extracting and retracting motion. The curved brake shoes comprise inductive material such that when current is passed through them they are attracted to each other imparting a brake force to the belt webbing. The rotateable spool, or belt reel, itself can also be provided with an eddy current brake to restrict the pay out of the belt during a crash or collision. The document is however silent as to how the belt can be retracted in a safe and secure manner without risking inflicting damages to the interior panel or the lacquer of the vehicle.</p><heading id="h0003">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p0005" num="0005">It is an object of the present invention to at least partly solve the above mentioned drawbacks, at least provide for an improvement, or at least provide for a useful alternative to existing solutions. The objective is at least partly met by a belt reel for a vehicle safety restraint arrangement. The belt reel comprises a retractable and extractable belt, a retraction mechanism adapted to retract the belt from an extracted position, and a belt retraction brake adapted to limit the retraction speed of the belt by imparting a braking force to the belt reel during retraction of the belt. The braking force of the belt retraction brake is imparted to the belt reel via inductance.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The belt reel can be configured to have a retraction mechanism which can be adapted to retract the belt using a higher load than what would otherwise be suitable as during the retraction of the belt, the retraction speed of the belt can thus be kept from peaking. If the retraction mechanism is a pre tensioned biasing member, such as a pre tensioned spring, the belt retraction brake also compensates for tolerances of the pre tensioned spring of the belt reel.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Furthermore, by using a retraction mechanism which retracts the belt using a higher load than what would otherwise be suitable, the risk of pinching the belt and possibly a belt buckle between a vehicle body and a door is reduced.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The belt retraction brake can be passive, passive in terms of that it requires no electricity to operate, i.e. no power source. Permanent magnets are advantageously used when the belt retraction brake is passive. In another embodiment it is conceivable that a power source is connected together with an electronic control unit (ECU), to better control the retraction brake properties of the belt reel.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">According to an aspect, belt retraction brake comprises a coil portion adapted to cooperate with the belt reel, and at least one magnet arranged on the belt reel. The inductance is thus imparted during the retraction of the belt and as the belt reel rotates. A permanent magnet is advantageously used.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to an aspect, the coil portion of the belt retraction brake comprises a drossel, or optionally a copper cylinder.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">According to an aspect, the belt reel can comprise a first and a second end and a belt portion arranged between the first and the second end of the belt reel. The belt can thus be wound up about the belt portion, at least after retraction of the belt. At least one end of the belt reel is adapted to form a part of the belt retraction brake, optionally both the first and the second end of the belt reel is adapted to form a part of the belt retraction brake.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The first and/or the second end of the belt reel can have different shapes and forms. For example, the first and/or the second end of the belt reel can be; symmetric or non symmetric; have a polygonal form such as triangular (or trigon), quadrilateral (or quadrangle or tetragon), pentagon, hexagon, heptagon, octagon, enneagon or nonagon, decagon. It should be noted that from decagon and above, the periphery can be considered more or less circular. Advantageously, the first and the second end comprise a substantially circular periphery, optionally a true circular periphery. It is possible that at least one end of the first and the second end of the belt reel comprises a non circular periphery.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The drossel, or copper cylinder, can be arranged in the proximity of the first and/or the second end of the belt reel.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">According to an aspect, at least one magnet is arranged on the first and/or second end of the belt reel. The magnet can be a permanent magnet. At least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more magnets can be arranged on the first and/or second end of the belt reel. A suitable number of magnets are between 6-20 magnets. The at least one magnet is advantageously arranged about the periphery of the first and/or second end of the belt reel.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">According to an aspect, the braking force of the belt retraction brake is about 1-30 W.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">According to an aspect, the belt retraction brake comprises a disc shaped element, such as a cupper disc, aluminium disc, or a disc a conductive material, and at least one permanent magnet. The disc shaped element can be arranged on the belt reel, and preferably on the first and/or second end of the belt reel. The at least one permanent magnet can be arranged on a fixed position with respect to the disc shaped element, such as a belt reel housing.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">According to an aspect, the retraction mechanism is adapted to impart a retraction force to the belt reel. The retraction force is rotating the belt reel so that the belt is retracted from an extracted position. The retraction force imparted to the belt reel by the retraction mechanism is larger than the braking force imparted to the belt reel via the belt retraction brake.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">According to a second aspect, the present invention also relates to a method for limiting the retraction speed of a belt arranged on a belt reel. The belt reel is adapted for a vehicle safety restraint arrangement, the method comprising the steps of;
<ul><li>retracting the belt onto a belt reel using a retraction mechanism;</li><li>limiting the maximum speed during the retraction by imparting a braking force to the belt reel using induction.</li></ul></p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The belt reel can be a belt reel according to any of the appended claims.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The present invention relates to a belt reel for a vehicle safety restraint arrangement.

To prevent the driver 10 from being injured in case of e.g. a collision, the driver 10 is buckled using a belt 14 comprising a buckle 15. The belt 14 extends from a belt reel 20 according to an embodiment of the present invention, the belt reel being positioned on a pillar 25 of the vehicle. The pillar 25 is also referred to as the A-pillar 25 of the vehicle 11. It should be noted that the belt reel 20 can be positioned in other positions in the vehicle 11. The belt reel 20 forms a vehicle safety restraint arrangement together with the belt 14 and the buckle 15 after being assembled to the vehicle 11.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Non limiting embodiments of the belt reel 20 will hereafter be described in greater detail. <figref idrefs="f0001">Figure 2</figref> shows an embodiment of the belt reel 20 comprising a belt 14 wound up about the belt reel 20. The belt 14 is transparently illustrated using dashed lines to better show the belt reel 20. The belt reel 20 permits the belt 14 to be extracted and retracted, e.g. to fasten a driver as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref>. The belt reel 20 comprises a retraction mechanism in the form of a spring (not shown) which is loaded as the belt 14 is retracted. If a user, such<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> as a driver, buckles up, the spring is loaded so as to retract the belt 14 after being unbuckled back to a position which generally is in the proximity of the belt reel 20. The belt reel 20 rotates about an axis of rotation A-A during the extraction or retraction of the belt 14. The belt reel 20 comprises a first and a second end 21, 22 and a belt section e23 extending between the first and the second end 21, 22. The belt section 23 is that part of the belt reel 20 about which the belt 14 is wound up about. A shaft 24 extends from the first and the second end 21, 22 of the belt reel 20. Further shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 2</figref> is a housing 25, adapted to enclose the belt reel 20, while permitting the belt 14 to extend through a slot or opening (not shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 2</figref>). For the sake of illustrating the belt reel 20, the housing 25 is shown with portions partly transparent. The shafts 24 are rotationally attached to the housing 25, which in turn is attached to the vehicle 11, in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref> in the proximity of the A-pillar 25 of the vehicle 11.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The belt reel 20 comprises a retraction mechanism, retraction means, to retract the belt 14 from an extracted position, e.g. when a driver unbuckles the belt 14 from the position shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref>. The retraction mechanism can be a spring which is pre tensioned, and loaded during the extraction of the belt 14 from the belt reel 20, other biasing members are possible, such as elastic polymer material, or an electric motor, or the like.

The magnet portion 31 can be formed by a plurality of magnets. A drossel 32 comprising an iron core 33 and a copper wire 34 wrapped about a portion of the iron core 33 provides for the conductor. As the belt reel 20 rotates, eddy currents will be formed in the drossel 32 generating an electromagnetic force which imparts a braking force to the belt reel 20, which in turn will limit the retraction speed of the belt 14 during belt retraction.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Some parameters which can be manipulated to increase the braking force imparted to the belt reel 20 are:
<ul><li>Use stronger magnets - increases remanence T.</li><li>Change fields faster (rotate the belt reel 20 faster) - increases the frequency.</li><li>Use thicker materials of the conductive material, care have to be taken not to use to thick material as the distance between the magnets may be to far.</li><li>Lower resistivity materials - decreases ρ.</li></ul></p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Using a belt retraction brake 30 during the retraction of the belt 14 is very advantageous, in practice; if the angular velocity of the belt reel 20 is increased the braking force of the belt retraction brake 30 will be significantly improved.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030"><figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 5</figref> shows another embodiment of a belt reel 20. <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 6</figref> shows a cross section of the belt reel 20 shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">figure 5</figref> along the line III-III. With reference to <figref idrefs="f0003">figures 5 and 6</figref>, the belt reel 20 comprises a belt 14, a first and a second end 21, 22 with a belt section 23 arranged therebetween. At the first end 21 of the belt reel 20 is an alternative belt retraction brake 30 arranged. The belt retraction brake 30 comprises in this case a circular copper ring 35 arranged about a magnet portion 31, in the form of a plurality of magnets, to create the braking force imparted to the belt reel 20, instead of a drossel as described above.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0031" num="0031"><figref idrefs="f0004">Figure 7</figref> shows a diagram comprising a first and a second graph A, B which represents the relation between the belt retraction brake 30 of the belt reel 20, described above using non limiting embodiments, and different types of damages which may occur during as a consequence of the retraction speed of the belt reel. The belt reel being positioned in a car as seen in <figref idrefs="f0001">figure 1</figref>.
