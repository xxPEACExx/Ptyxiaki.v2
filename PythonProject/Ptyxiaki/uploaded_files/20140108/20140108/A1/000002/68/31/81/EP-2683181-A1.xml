Field of the Invention</b></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to the field of wireless communications, and more particularly to an apparatus and the method for providing remote communication of an electronic device in a communication network environment.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>2. Description of the Related Art</b></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Wireless communication systems are evolving constantly. Designers are continuously developing a greater number of features for both network operators as well as for the end users. In the area of wireless phone systems, cellular based phone systems have advanced tremendously in the prior art. Electronic devices, being a genuine invention in the era of mankind, play a vital role even today to connect people at any corner of the world in a matter of seconds, or fetching information on the latest technology updates.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Some wireless communication systems comply with Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)/3GPP2 standards 27.007 and 27.005. The 3GPP/3GPP2 is collaboration between groups of telecommunications associations, known as the Organizational Partners. The initial scope of 3GPP was to implement a globally applicable third generation (3G) mobile phone system specification based on evolved Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) specifications within the scope of the International Mobile Telecommunications-2000 project of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). If a user wishes to control an electronic device using a computer, then the 3GPP/3GPP2 standards 27.007 and 27.005 may be used where attention (AT) commands are used to perform the control operation.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The AT command used in a modem device of a personal computer automatically recognizes and responds to the communication rate and a communication parameter between a data terminal equipment (DTE) and a Data<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> circuit terminating equipment (DCE). The AT command is implemented such that the first two characters of the AT command are limited to "AT" or "at". "AT" generally refers to letters that get the attention of an electronic device. A computing device having communication capabilities may have a modem section for communicating signals with a communication line in order to send and receive a message for a Short Message Service (SMS) and a processing unit for executing AT commands such as a digital command signal (DCS) reception command for requesting reception of a DCS to the modem section. The electronic device includes a circuit called a Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART), which receives the start and stop synchronous AT commands and proceeds to perform a communication in accordance with the received AT command. An automatic recognition method for measuring the timing and spacing of the start and stop bits is therefore needed to detect the rate of reception from the other side of the communication link, and to set a frequency of a baud rate for recognizing and responding to the communication rate and a communication parameter between DTE and a DCE. Further the serial communication unit of an external DTE device, such as a personal computer (PC), can communicate with the serial interface of an electronic device using a serial channel. The electronic device comprises an AT command module which is integrated into baseband chip of the electronic device and connected to the serial interface of the electronic device. This connection enables the AT command to perform various operations such as call services, SMS, supplementary services, GPRS data services, and various functions for controlling the electronic device such as operating a phonebook, obtaining an International Mobile Station Equipment Identity (IMEI), and so on.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">As a way of performing a communication, a computer sends an AT command to an electronic device using a serial interface and controls the electronic device through the AT command, so as to implement the GSM/UMTS interaction. The user can operate or control the function configuration, such as call message Short Message Service (SMS) through the AT command. The AT command not only controls GSM related services such as call services, the SMS, supplementary services and GPRS data services, but also controls the functions of the electronic device, such as operating the phonebook, obtaining IMEI, etc. Thus it is easy for any user to take direct control of the electronic device without<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> accessing the user interface device such as a keypad. The above communication is restricted to DCE and a DTE communication using the AT command, and is limited to a wired environment. Also, some of the existing methods control the remote electronic device using some specific commands that are predefined by the owner or user of the remote electronic device to control and operate the electronic device with wireless methods and communications.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Due to abovementioned reasons, it becomes clear that the existing methods control the electronic device using a computer or by using pre-defined commands to control and operate the remote electronic device. Further, a method to control and operate the remote electronic device, by wireless radio access communication employing existing AT commands, is needed.</p><heading id="h0004"><b>SUMMARY</b></heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">The present invention is to provide a method and apparatus for using the pre-defined 3GPP/3GPP2 standard (27.007 and 27.005) mobile commands (AT commands) for enabling communication between two remotely located electronic devices.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The present invention is also to provide a method and apparatus to create an AT command of an electronic device and send the command signal to a remote electronic device through a SMS.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In addition, the present invention is to provide a method and apparatus to provide security to access the electronic device from a remote location and restrict unauthorized access.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The present invention provides a method for remote communication of an electronic device in a communication network environment, and the method comprises sending a short message (SM) including an AT command from a controlling electronic device, analyzing and parsing the AT command for determining at least one task to be performed at the electronic device on detecting that the SM is for a control operation, and performing the at least one task.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The present invention also provides an apparatus for remote communication of the electronic device in a communication network environment, wherein the apparatus comprises a control entity for sending the short message (SM) including the AT command from the controlling electronic device, analyzing and parsing the AT command for determining at least one task to be<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> performed at the electronic device on detecting that the SM is for a control operation, and performing the at least one task.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">These and other aspects of the exemplary embodiments of the present invention herein will be better appreciated and understood when considered in conjunction with the following description and the accompanying drawings.

In particular, each icon has a mapping relation with any function being executable in the electronic device or with any data stored in the electronic device and is used for processing functions or selecting data in the electronic device. When a user selects one of the displayed icons, the electronic device identifies a particular function or data associated with the selected icon. Then the electronic device executes the identified function or displays the identified data.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Among the terms set forth herein, data refers to any kind of information processed by the electronic device, including text and/or images received from any external entities, messages transmitted or received, and information created when a specific function is executed by the electronic device.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The exemplary embodiments of the present invention herein achieve a method and apparatus to control a remote electronic device using AT commands which may be applied for versatile control applications usage on any electronic<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> device. The method uses AT commands, as discussed in 3GPP/3GPP2 (27.007 and 27.005) and which are well-known in the art. The method uses generic commands that may be easily mapped or converted to a standard AT command internally and to re-use the existing functionality that is bound with the AT command to serve the purpose of a control application. Since the specification defines a standard for all AT commands which can be executed by an AT parser, the method generates and sends such AT commands from a controlling electronic device and performs a remote application task on a controlled electronic device which can be remotely located from the controlling electronic device. Another purpose of using the AT commands is its usage results in re-using the existing AT command library and its built-in functionality to serve any application purpose, instead of having an overhead of applying new functionalities.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Referring now to the drawings in <figref idrefs="f0001 f0002 f0003 f0004 f0005 f0006">FIGS. 1 through 6</figref>, where similar reference numerals refer to corresponding features consistently throughout the figures, there are shown exemplary embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022"><figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a block diagram of two electronic devices, according to the exemplary embodiments of the present invention as disclosed herein. As depicted in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, the method controls an application such that such control extends between an electronic device, which may be local or remote to the user, and other remote electronic devices operating in a wireless environment.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In the exemplary embodiment, the electronic device described throughout the description herein may be a mobile phone, a PDA, a tablet and so on, having a processor, an input unit, a display unit, a memory, and a transceiver in a manner known in the art. For example, for wireless communications, the transceiver may include a transmitter, a receiver, and an antenna, and for wired communications, the transceiver may include a wire-based communications interface. In the exemplary embodiments described herein, the electronic devices implement wireless communications and therefore include known wireless components, but in alternative embodiments, wired communications as well as combinations of wired and wireless communications may also be implemented by the electronic devices to implement the present invention.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The electronic device which sends the AT command is referred to as a controlling electronic device 101 and the electronic device that receives the command is referred to as a controlled electronic device 102. The controlling<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> electronic device 101 comprises several modules such as a user interface (UI) interface module 103, an AT command library module 104, an encryption module 105 and a short message (SM) module 106.

The encryption module 105 in the controlling electronic device 101 provides security to send the AT command to the controlled electronic device 102. The encryption module 105 encrypts the outgoing AT command with a key to provide a secured communication between electronic devices 101, 102. The SM module 106 enables the controlling electronic device 101 to send the AT command to the controlled electronic device 102 through a short message service (SMS).</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The user interface module 103 may optimally not display the AT commands to a user. Instead, AT commands are displayed in a plain-language format to a user through the display, controlled by the UI interface module 103, in the form of library keywords that are easily understandable in a predetermined natural language, such as English, Korean, Hindi, German, French, Italian, Spanish, etc., such as the English words and abbreviations CALL FWD, CALL END and so on.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The controlling electronic device 101 may transmit at least one control signal in the form of AT commands to the controlled electronic device 102 to elicit many types of responses, corresponding to the AT commands, from the receiving controlled electronic device 102. The controlling electronic device 101 sends the AT commands to the controlled electronic device 102 through wireless communication, such as radio waves in a manner known in the art. In the exemplary embodiment, communication link circuitry may advantageously be implemented as any known wireless radio access communication which has standardized special packets for transmitting digital signals such as a SMS transmission linked to the UMTS technology.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In another exemplary embodiment, the wireless radio access technology may be GSM, General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), LTE, CDMA and the like.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The controlled electronic device 102 comprises multiple modules such as a SM processing module 107, a control entity 108, and an AT command interpreter module 109. The controlled electronic device 102, upon receiving the SM from the controlling electronic device 101, processes the SM using the SM processing module 107. The control entity 108, which is connected to the SM processing module 107 and to the AT command interpreter or AT parser module 109, includes a storage module to store the user configured security key information to authenticate the user when accessing the controlled electronic device 102 from the controlling electronic device 101. The control entity 108 analyses the SM received from the controlling electronic device 101 and checks for user keyword information included in the SM. The user keyword information is pre-defined number N of bytes of ASCII characters to determine if the SM is a control SM or a normal user SM. The controlled electronic device 102 receives the AT command through the SMS and performs an operation or task using the AT command interpreter module 109. The AT command interpreter module 109 provides a response of an execution of the AT command embedded inside the SM, using the AT parser. In addition to or instead of placing a call or receiving a call, such a response may also change the status of the electronic device 102, such as activating circuitry in the electronic device 102 for receiving any information of the electronic device 101 or to control the electronic device 102.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In an alternative embodiment, the controlling electronic device 101 may also include such an SM processing module, control entity, and AT command interpreter module as in the controlled electronic device 102, so that the controlling electronic device 101 may, alternatively, be controlled by another electronic device implementing the components described herein for the controlling electronic device 101 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Similarly, in another alternative embodiment, the controlled electronic device 102 may also include such a UI interface module, encryption module, AT command library module, and SM module as in controlling electronic device 101, so that the controlled electronic device 102 may, alternatively, control another electronic device implementing the components described herein for the controlled electronic device 102 as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031"><figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the flow chart showing the steps involved in processing a AT command SM in the controlled electronic device 102, according to exemplary<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> embodiments as disclosed herein. As depicted in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, the flow chart describes a method that checks the contents of the SM text which contains the control data and control information subjected to processing after being at the remotely placed controlled electronic device 102. The controlled electronic device 102 receives the SM from the controlling electronic device 101 through a SMS in step 201. On receiving the SM, the controlled electronic device 102 checks for any keyword in the SM in step 202. For example, the user or the electronic device 101 may start the SM text with the keyword "TO_MY_MOBILE" as a user defined keyword identifier which appears as part of the control information sent through the SMS. This keyword is used to distinguish a normal user SM from an AT command SM at the receiving end, with the AT command SM including or having embedded therein the AT command. Since both the AT commands and the SM are composed of text, the AT command may be easily inserted or embedded into an SM in a manner known in the art for creating and modifying SMs. If the user-defined keyword is not present in the SM, as determined in step 202, then the controlled electronic device sets the SM as a normal SM in step 203, and the method of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> ends. Otherwise, if the user-defined keyword is present in the SM, as determined in step 202, the controlled electronic device extracts the AT command and, optionally, any header from the received SM in step 204. If the SM received by the controlled electronic device 102 is identified as an AT command SM, then the remaining part of the control information in the SM is processed further for verification such that the authenticity of the sender is verified by matching a password with stored passwords in the memory of the controlled electronic device 102. The controlled electronic device 102 checks for a password in the AT command in step 205. If a password is not found in step 205, the method proceeds to step 209. However, if a password is found in step 205, the method checks for a match of the password with the stored passwords in step 206. If no password match is found in step 206, the method proceeds to step 209. However, if a password match is found in step 206, then the controlled electronic device 102 authenticates the sender in step 207, and proceeds to step 210. Referring back to step 209, if the controlled electronic device 102 did not find any password in step 205 or did not find any password match in step 206, then the electronic device 102 checks if the SM is sent from a security exception number associated with the controlling electronic device 101<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> in step 209. If the SM was not sent from a security exception number in step 209, the method of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> ends. Otherwise, if the SM was sent from a security exception number in step 209, the method proceeds to step 210. If the controlled electronic device 102 identifies the SM is sent from the security exception number, the authentication method of step 207 will not be performed. After successful authentication in step 207 or after step 210, the control information is executed by the AT command parser of the controlled electronic device 102 for generating a new task. The controlled electronic device 102 checks if the AT command is a mobile service (MS) AT command to be locally performed at the controlled electronic device 102, or a network AT command in step 210. If the AT command is a network AT command, then the new task generated interacts with the network and process the AT command in step 212, and proceeds to step 213. If the controlled electronic device 102 identifies that the AT command is a mobile AT command in step 210, then a new generated task will interact internally with the electronic device to perform the user task in step 211 for which the control information was intended by the controlling electronic device 101, and the method proceeds to step 213. In an alternative exemplary embodiment, the method may also a supplementary services (SS) string with the forwarded number to the network. Referring to step 213, the controlled electronic device 102 finally sends the success or failure result to the controlled electronic device 102 through the SMS in step 213. The various actions in the method of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> may be performed in the order presented, in a different order, or simultaneously. Further, in some exemplary embodiments, some actions listed in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> may be omitted.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In alternative exemplary embodiments, the controlling electronic device 101 may act as the controlled electronic device and receives the SM embedded with a AT command from any electronic device to perform control operations of the electronic device 101 which is then a controlled electronic device.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In another alternative exemplary embodiment, the controlled electronic device 102 acts as a controlling electronic device and sends the SM embedded with the AT command to any electronic device.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034"><figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a display screen displayed by a controlled electronic device 102, as in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, that is configured for the incoming AT command SM, according to the exemplary embodiments as disclosed herein. The AT command<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> SM settings 301 are configured to receive and authenticate the AT command from the controlling electronic device 101. The settings are configured initially by the user, or alternatively may be default settings determined at the time of manufacture of the electronic devices 101, 102. The user defined keyword 302 refers to an input field used by the controlled electronic device 102 to identify that the incoming SM is a AT command SM. The input field 302 may be a field for receiving input text, such as letters, number, characters, and symbols, using an input unit, such as a touch screen of the electronic devices 101, 102, with the screen showing the settings 301 in a graphic user interface (GUI). The security key 303 is a password that the user configures in the controlled electronic device 102 for authentication purpose. In the exemplary embodiment, the user configures the security key as XXXXX then when user wants to send the AT command SM from another electronic device to access the electronic device of the user, which the user has left in his home or other remote location, then the user has to provide the same security key XXXXX for the remote electronic device, to be a controlled electronic device 102, for authentication. At any point of time, the user may change the security key by entering a new security key into a Change Security Key input field 304, for example, by pressing the Edit icon on the screen in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>. After configuring the electronic device, the user may save the configured AT command settings in the controlled electronic device 102 by pressing the Save icon on the screen in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>. In the exemplary embodiment of the present invention, there may be one option in the configuration settings in which the user may set an exception number 305 in the electronic device to avoid checking the security key, as described in connection with step 209 of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>. In the exemplary embodiment, the exception number 305 is stored in the memory of the controlled electronic device 102. This exception number may be a trusted number, and when the user sends the AT command from a controlling electronic device 101 which holds this exception number, then the SM received by the receiving controlled electronic device 102 will not check the sender, that is, the controlled electronic device 101, as the sender for security purposes. For example, the user configures his electronic device with a security exception number as XXXX in the input field 305 in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>. When the user wants to control his electronic device remotely as a controlled electronic device 102, then the user sends the AT command SM from the controlling electronic device 101, which<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> holds the security exception number that the user has configured on his phone initially. When the user sends the AT command SM with the same security exception number XXXX, then his electronic device, as the controlled electronic device 102, will not check for the security key since the configured security exception number XXXX matched with the received security exception XXXX number matched with the mobile number of the sending or controlling electronic device 101. Such use of the exception number assists the user to send the AT command SM from any trusted remote electronic device as a controlling electronic device 102, which does not include the security information for authentication. In the exemplary embodiment, the controlling electronic device 101 sends an AT command SM to the controlled electronic device 102. In this case, the controlling electronic device 101 may be configured to only send the AT command SM to the controlled electronic device 102, and the controlled electronic device 102 may not execute any AT command when the controlled electronic device 102 receives any AT command SM from any electronic device other than the controlling electronic device 101.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The controlled electronic device 102 may also be configured to have a validity period, which is input into the input field 306 displayed on the screen of <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>. The validity period in the validity period field 306 is a time duration, which may be measured in minutes or in other time units, that is configured by the user or is set by default by the manufacturer to accept a delay in receiving an AT command SM. The control entity 108 in the controlled electronic device 102 checks if the received AT command SM is received within the set validity time from the time that the AT command SM was sent by the controlling electronic device 101. The delay may be due to transmission delays of the network providing the communication channel between the electronic devices 101, 102 in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, or may be due to processing delays of the controlling electronic device 101. In the exemplary embodiment, the validity period is stored in the memory of the controlled electronic device 102.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In another exemplary embodiment, due to some error in the network, the controlling electronic device 101 attempts to send the same message more than once, which may result in duplicates of the same AT command SM sent at least twice to the controlled electronic device 102. In this case, the controlling electronic device 101, when sending the SM to the controlled electronic device<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> 102, includes a known Transfer Protocol-reject duplicate (TP-RD) information for identifying and rejecting or ignoring any occurrence of duplication of the same message at the Network Short Message Service Center (SMSC) providing the communication channel between the electronic devices 101, 102 in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The control entity 108 of the controlled electronic device 102 checks the incoming AT command SM as having a format such as &lt;Keyword&gt;&lt;Header&gt;&lt;Content&gt;.

Such prompting of the user is for the security concerns when reusing the same SM from an outbox of the controlling electronic device 10 after sending the SM for a first time. The &lt;Content&gt; field is used by the electronic device to include or embed the AT command which is used, when extracted, to control a remote mobile application in the controlled electronic device 102.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039"><figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a display screen displayed by a controlling electronic device 101, as in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>, that uses an AT command library for creating and sending an AT command SM to the controlled electronic device 102, according to the exemplary embodiments as disclosed herein. <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 4</figref> depicts the controlling electronic device 101 that comprise an AT command library for the user to choose the AT command by choosing a corresponding plain-language text or keyword, and send the AT command to the controlled electronic device 102.
