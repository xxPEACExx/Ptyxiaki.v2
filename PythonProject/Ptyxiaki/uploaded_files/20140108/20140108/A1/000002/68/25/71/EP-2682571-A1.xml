The publication mentions for the alloy Inconel 671 that it only has to be welded on, while for the alloy Inconel 625 it mentions that after the welding it contains a dendritic carbide structure and that the seat area therefore has to be hot-worked to homogenise the carbide distribution in the structure in order to improve corrosion resistance. Inconel alloy 625 is mentioned to have a composition of up to 0.10% C, up to 0.5% Si, up to 5% Fe, up to 0.5% Mn, 21% Cr, up to 0.4% Ti, up to 0.4% Al, up to 1.0% Co, 9% Mo, 3.6% Nb + Ta, and the balance Ni.

In a valve having a seat material different from the base material, the book calls the seat material a hardfacing. The hardfacings standing out during all the tests were Deloro alloy 60: 16% Cr, 4.5% Si, 4.5% Fe, 3.5% B, 0.5% C, and the balance Ni; Colmonoy 8: 26% Cr, 4% Si, 3.3% B, 1.0% Fe, 0.95% C, and the balance Ni; and Tristelle TS2: 35% Cr, 12% Co, 10% Ni, 5% Si, 2.0% C, and the balance Fe. It was concluded on page 143 that chromising offers no significant improvement in corrosion protection to nickel based alloys for exhaust valves. It is quite clearly difficult to choose an alloy having the required properties for a seat material in an exhaust valve, in particular when the fuel burned in the engine contains vanadium and sulphur.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004"><patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="WO9618747A"><text>WO 96/18747</text></patcit> describes an exhaust valve spindle with a welded-on hardfacing alloy analyzed at 40-51% Cr, from 0 to 0.1% C, less than 1.0% Si, from 0 to 5.0% Mn, less than 1.0% Mo, from 0.05 to 0.5% B, from 0 to 1.0% Al, from 0 to 1.5% Ti, from 0 to 0.2% Zr, from 0.5 to 3.0% Nb, an aggregate content of Co and Fe of 5.0% at the most, at the most 0.2% O, at the most 0.3% N, and the balance Ni. Following the welding a high hardness of 550 HV20 may be imparted to the seat material by means of a heat treatment at a temperature exceeding 550°C. It is generally presumed that hot-corrosion-resistant alloys containing chromium and nickel, age-harden at temperatures ranging from 550°C to 850°C, with the result that the alloy becomes harder and more brittle. Attempts to make welded-on hardfacings having a high content of Cr are typically damaged by hot cracks developed during solidification and cooling at the welding process, however <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="WO9618747A"><text>WO 96/18747</text></patcit> describes that the content of B of at least 0.05% (preferably at least 0.2% boron) in the alloy causes the hot cracks to be reduced or disappear. Furthermore, the content of Ti should be kept below 0.1% and the content of Al should be kept below 0.1% in order to suppress precipitation hardening at welding. <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="WO9618747A"><text>WO 96/18747</text></patcit> discloses three specific alloys, all having above 48% Cr and 0.1% B, and in these alloys the precipitation hardening mechanism acts so slowly that the alloy substantially does not harden at welding onto the valve, but hardens during a subsequent heat treatment.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In the case of cast members, to achieve excellent hot corrosion resistance, particularly in environments containing sulphur and vanadium from heavy fuel oil combustion products, it is known to use an alloy of the type 50% Cr and 50% Ni, or an alloy of the type IN 657 having a design composition of 48-52% Cr, 1.4-1.7% Nb, at the most 0.1% C, at the most 0.16% Ti, at the most 0.2% C+N, at the most 0.5% Si, at the most 1.0% Fe, at the most 0.3% Mg, and the balance Ni. After casting, the alloy comprises a nickel-rich γ-phase and a chromium-rich α-phase where both phases, depending on the accurate analysis of the alloy, may constitute the primary dendrite structure. It is known that these alloys age-harden at operating temperatures exceeding 600°C. As the alloy after casting cools off, the alloy does not solidify in its equilibrium state. When subsequently the alloy is at operating temperature, precipitation of the under-represented phase proportion occurs by transformation of the over-represented phase proportion,<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> which causes embrittlement characterized in a ductility of less than 4% at room temperature.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The exhaust valve spindle can be provided with a corrosion resistant alloy on the lower surface facing the combustion chamber. This lower surface is far from being subjected to mechanical action, like the influences acting on the valve seat, but the corrosion resistance needs to be high. <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="WO9747862A"><text>WO 97/47862</text></patcit> generally describes an alloy comprising from 38 to 75% Cr, from 0 to 3.0% Nb, and a balance of Ni, where the corrosion-resistant alloy has a hardness of less than 310 HV measured at approximately 20°C after the material has been heated to a temperature within the range of 550-850°C for more than 400 hours. A specific example described is an alloy comprising 46% Cr, 0.4% Ti, 0.05% C, and the balance Ni.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">From the market it is known to provide a welded-on hardfacing of Inconel 718 onto a valve base material of stainless steel where the hardfacing is rolled and heat treated in order to provide the seat material with the desired mechanical properties. In Inconel 718 the content of Fe is necessary for the slow precipitation of strength increasing particles. This slow precipitation is considered unique to Inconel 718 and has provided this alloy with special advantages among superalloys within in particular the turbine industry. Inconel 718 has the composition 19% Cr, 5.2% Nb, 0.9% Ti, 52.5% Ni, 3% Mo, 0.5% Al, and the balance Fe. A valve of this type has the advantage that Inconel 718 has excellent mechanical properties as required for a valve seat area, including strength and ductility. Unfortunately, a valve of this type does not have a corrosion resistance at high temperatures comparable to or better than the corrosion resistance of Nimonic 80A. Nimonic 80A is not weldable, and consequently it is required to make the entire valve disc out of Nimonic 80A as it cannot be provided as a hardfacing on a base material like stainless steel.

Experiments suggest that an aggregate amount of Nb and Ta of 2.8% can be sufficient for the desired effect, at least when combined with higher amounts of Ti. And an aggregate amount of Nb and Ta higher than 6.1% seems to cause too quick precipitation. Amounts of Ti higher than 2.0% accelerate the precipitation and is assumed to involve other types of precipitation than the desired γ". Experiments further suggest that if the amount of Ti is larger than 1.5% then it is required that the amount of Nb + 0.5 x Ta is less than 3.0% or otherwise precipitation seems to occur too quickly.

When the engine is running the exhaust valve is heated to an elevated temperature, and the severeness of corrosion attacks from the chemical substances in the exhaust gas is heavily increasing with temperature. The mechanical properties of the seat material are naturally important because combustion residue particles will get caught between the closing valve seat surfaces on the movable exhaust valve spindle and the stationary valve seat on the valve housing mounted in the cylinder section of the engine. The mechanical properties are also important because the valve seat surfaces close onto each other with high forces, as the maximum combustion pressure acts on the full lower side area of the exhaust<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> valve spindle and is transferred to the stationary valve housing part via the valve seat area, which has a much smaller area than the area of the lower side of the valve.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">It is thus quite natural that much focus has been on the mechanical properties of the seat material. However, it is for the durability of the exhaust valve also important to consider the high-temperature corrosion resistance. When a combustion residue particle actually gets caught between the closing valve seat surfaces it will deform the surfaces. If a part of this deformation is plastic then a risk is present for blow-by of combustion gasses. This involves hot combustion gas that flows through a channel across the valve seat surfaces, and because the combustion gasses are hot the blow-by will cause significant heating of the seat material surrounding the channel, and the increased temperature will cause increased corrosion attacks. It is highly desirable that the seat material is able to withstand such a corrosion attack. The significant increase in the content of Cr in the seat material, and the reduction in the content of Fe - as compared with Inconel 718 - involve a considerable increase in the high-temperature corrosion resistance. At the same time the seat material has achieved very high mechanical strength, and quite importantly has achieved the strength by a strengthening mechanism that is initially somewhat delayed but otherwise rather quickly obtained in the seat material during heat treatment.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In an embodiment the aggregate amount of Nb and Ta in the alloy of the seat material is in the range from 3.2 to 6.1%.

Seat area 10 is annular and located next to a rounded outer end portion of the valve disc. The stationary part 12 is cooled by water circulating through cooling bores 13. The exhaust valve spindle has a shaft 14, which shaft extends upwards from the valve disc and across the exhaust channel and continues upwards through a guiding bore in the exhaust valve housing 8 and up into an exhaust valve actuator 16.

The outer diameter of the exhaust valve disc 11 is in the range from 100 mm to 600 mm, depending on the cylinder bore, when the valve is for such two-stroke engines. The internal combustion engine utilizing the exhaust valve spindles may be of the make MAN Diesel &amp; Turbo, such as of the type MC, ME or GI, or may be of the make Wärtsilä, such as of the type RTA of RTA-flex, or may be of the make Mitsubishi.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The following exemplifies how an exhaust valve is made. There is firstly provided a valve disc of a base material. The valve disc is typically forged out and has an annular recess 20 in its upper surface, which recess extends a distance down below the upper surface of the valve disc (<figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 3</figref>). This distance is typically in the range from 15 to 50% of the vertical thickness of the valve disc at the radial location of the annular valve seat. For the larger exhaust valves the distance is typically in the range from 6 mm to 40 mm, such as from 6 to 30 mm. The base material is typically a stainless steel, such as an alloy having 0.25% C, 1.4% Si, 1.3% Mn, 20% Cr, 9% Ni, 3% W, and the balance Fe. Other stainless steels can also be used and are well-known in the art of exhaust valves. It is also possible to use a superalloy, like Nimonic 80A, as the base material. The valve disc can be made in a single piece with the stem, but it is also possible to make the valve disc with only the lowermost portion of the stem, and then mount the main portion of the stem after the valve disc has been heat treated. Such mounting can e.g. be performed by friction welding or welding.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The valve seat material 21 is then provided in the recess as illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 4</figref>. This can be done in several manners. Preferably, the valve seat<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> material is provided by a powder metallurgical process, such as HIP or laser welding or cold spaying. When done by the so-called Cold Spray process a hot gas jet is produced by introducing a preheated and compressed inert gas into a nozzle. Powder particles in the size range of 1 - 50 micron are introduced into the stream and thereby accelerated to supersonic speed, allowing the powder particles to bond and deposit on suitable substrates, like the base material forming the recess in the valve disc or already deposited powder particles. In contrast to other thermal spraying processes the powder particles do not melt at any point in the Cold Spray process. Typical process parameters for the Cold Spray process are: Gas pressure in the range of 30 - 50 bar; gas preheat temperature in the range of 500 - 1000°C; powder flow in the range of 50 - 150 g/min; powder velocity in the range of 600 - 2000 m/sec. Also a variant of the Cold Spray process in the form of a laser assisted Cold Spray process can be applied. By continuously preheating the substrate ahead of the position of deposition of the powder, the process can be optimized to enable a high deposit quality also at the lower range of process parameters. Cold spraying is followed by a solution heat treatment, e.g. at 1100°C for 1 hour, in order to achieve full metallurgical binding through diffusion of components in the structure of the valve seat material.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The particulate material may be obtained in several different manners which are well-known in the art. The particulate materials may, for example, have been manufactured by atomisation of a liquid jet of a melted alloy of the desired composition into a chamber with an inactive atmosphere, whereby the material is quenched and solidifies as particles with a very fine dendritic structure. The particulate material may also be called a powder.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">When the seat material is formed by means of a HIP process, the valve disc of the base material, such as steel, alloyed steel or a nickel alloy, is manufactured in the usual manner to the desired shape including the recess for the seat material. Then the desired seat material in the form of particulate or powder is filled into the recess and applied on the base body by a well-known HIP process (HIP is an abbreviation of Hot Isostatic Pressure). The valve disc with the powder filled into the recess is then arranged in a mould and placed in a HIP chamber which is closed, and a vacuum is applied to extract undesired gases. Alternatively, the valve disc with the powder<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> filled into the recess is arranged in a capsule which is subsequently evacuated to extract undesired gasses, and then sealed and placed in a HIP chamber. Then the HIP process is started, in which the particulate material is heated to a temperature ranging between 950 and 1200°C, and a high pressure of, for example 700-1200 bar is applied by argon gas. At these conditions the starting powder becomes plastic and is unified to a coherent dense material substantially without melting. Then the valve disc is removed, and if desired it can then be exposed to solution annealing, for example for 1 hour at a temperature of 1150°C followed by quenching either in a salt bath to an intermediate temperature (typically 535°C) followed by air cooling to room temperature, or by quenching in gases to room temperature.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">In the next step the seat material is cold deformed. This can be done in traditional manner by forging, or hammering, however for large valves rolling is preferred. <figref idrefs="f0003">Fig. 5</figref> illustrates the outer end area of a rolling tool 22 being moved towards the outer surface of the seat material. The rolling tool is only in contact with a small area on the outer surface, compared with the complete area of the annular valve seat, and the forces required to perform the cold deformation are thus considerably smaller than the forces required for forging. On the other hand rolling is more time consuming than forging. The degree of cold deformation for the particular valve can vary, such as in the range from 4 to 60%. <figref idrefs="f0001">Fig. 6</figref> illustrates the valve disc after the cold deformation.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The valve seat material can also be provided by forging on powder placed in the recess 20, like the forging described in <patcit id="pcit0007" dnum="WO2011050815A"><text>WO2011/050815</text></patcit>, to which reference is made.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The valve disc may then be subjected to heat treatment causing hardening by precipitation of γ" (Ni<sub>3</sub>Nb) particles in body-centered-tetragonal configuration, followed by the valve disc being machined into the desired dimensions and the desired rounded outer edge at its largest diameter. It is also possible to perform the machining first, followed by the heat treatment causing hardening by precipitation of γ" (Ni<sub>3</sub>Nb) particles in body-centered-tetragonal configuration.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Examples are now given of different alloys.</p><heading id="h0001"><u>Example 1</u></heading><!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --><p id="p0044" num="0044">Test specimens were made of 7 alloys according to the present invention and 9 alloys for comparison purposes. The main alloying elements Cr, Nb, Ta, Ti and Ni were determined by EDX, Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, using normalized measurements. The measured and normalized values for alloying elements are set out in the following Table 1 where the alloys numbered 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 21 and 22 are in accordance with the present invention. Each test specimen was laser welded onto a steel substrate, and the test specimens were solution heat treated at 1100°C for 1 hour followed by quenching. Then one set of the test specimens was heat treated at 700°C and another set of the same test specimens was heat treated at 800°C, and the hardness of the individual test specimen was measured by HV10 after 0 hours, 1 hour, 3 hours, 9 hours and 81 hours. Alloy No. 9 showed a very slow increase in hardness, with only an increase of about 70 HV10 after 9 hours at 700°C, but after 81 hours the increase was about 230 HV10. The alloy thus exhibits the desired slow precipitation, but is for practical use too slow. The alloys Nos. 6-7, and 15-20 all showed a quick increase in hardness within the first hour, and the precipitation hardening mechanism is thus not to a sufficient extent of the desired γ" type but is predominantly of γ' or other types (traditional types). Alloy No. 10 only achieved a hardness of about 310 HV10 after 81 hours, and is thus not able to deliver the desired mechanical strength in the valve seat material.

For each allying component the detected signals were compared to signals from a standardised probe of the component in order to determine the actual content of the component in the test specimen. The measured values are set out in the following Table 2. The treatment of the test specimens is described in Example 1. Alloy No. 9-1 showed a very slow increase in hardness. Alloys Nos. 13-1 and 14-1 have hardness increase during the first three hours at 700°C but then flatten out at a level of about 360 HV10. Alloys Nos. 11-1, 12-1, 21-1 and 22-1 show gradual hardness increase over many hours at 700°C up to levels of about 450 HV10. The measurements showed a too high content of Fe in Alloy 14-1 which is believed to be caused by undesired blending in of Fe from the steel substrate during the welding process.
