Lath assemblies with corner caps are often regarded by the public as visually non attractive. Mostly, the corner caps are made of plastic. A first problem is that many times the colour of the caps differ from the combined laths. Furthermore, after a while, the plastic corner caps decolour which further negatively affects the finishing performance. Such corner caps are for example known from <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="KR101015001"><text>KR101015001</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003"><patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US20070125020A"><text>US2007/0125020</text></patcit> discloses in Fig. 9 and 10, a trim molding system comprising a first and second trim piece which can be assembled to each other by an angled corner tab to obtain a mitre corner joint. The trim pieces have mitred edges. The angled corner tab is configured to fit into corresponding keyways formed in the trim pieces. When assembled, the trim pieces are pressed towards each other and meet at a joint angle defined by the angled corner tab. The tabs and keyways are jointed with a press fit, but can also be joined by using an adhesive or a fastener.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The disclosed trim molding system has a drawback in that the obtained joint is not satisfying. In some cases the joint is still noticeable by a small gap and the joint needs to be filled with putty, caulk, and adhesive to provide a better aesthetical appearance.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005"><patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US20050155312A"><text>US2005/0155312</text></patcit> discloses a trim assembly including a corner-piece member with tangs extending therefrom. The tangs are typically molded integrally with the corner-piece member. A pair of spaced apart tangs extend from each side of the corner-piece member. The tangs are T-shaped in cross section. An outer portion of the tangs may be tapered to facilitate entry of the outer portions of respective tangs into slots in a decorative moulding section which have to be connected with the corner-piece member. Additional block<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> members with posts and separate leaf spring members are provided to secure the longitudinal moulding sections in position.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">A problem to this known trim assembly is that after a certain period of time the trim assembly is vulnerable to occurring gaps in between the connected items.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Also <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="EP1808548A"><text>EP1.808.548</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="WO2006122346A"><text>W02006/122346</text></patcit> disclose trim assemblies which are also not satisfactory by gaps occurring between the connected items. <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="WO2006122346A"><text>W02006/122346</text></patcit> provides a solution to this problem by filling slight gaps with the aid of a gap filler or adhesive. However, this measure requires additional operational steps which are undesirable.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The general object of the present invention is to at least partially eliminate the above mentioned drawbacks and/or to provide a useable alternative. More specific, it is an object of the invention to provide a mitre corner assembly for forming a mitre connection which can be easily manually installed and provides an improved aesthetical appearance.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">According to the invention, this object is achieved by a lath assembly according to claim 1.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The lath assembly according to the invention is provided to obtain a finishing of a crossing of a sidewall and a floor or ceiling. The lath assembly according to the invention comprises a combination of at least a first and second lath. In particular, the lath assembly comprises a pair of a first and a second lath. Each lath of the combination comprises a longitudinal body having a first end and a second end. The longitudinal body defines a longitudinal direction in a length direction. The longitudinal body has a first and second end face. The longitudinal body is provided with a keyway at its first end. The keyway forms a female part. The female part is configured to receive a male part of another component. The keyway has a keyway opening at the first end face. The lath assembly further comprises a connector for connecting the first ends of the pair of laths to each other. The connector comprises two key members to be inserted into the respective keyways of the laths to be connected. After establishing a connection, the first and second key members of the connector extend through the respective keyway openings at the end faces of the laths. Herewith, the connector is positioned at an inner side of the laths. After mounting the lath assembly to a sidewall only the outside of the lath assembly is visible which provides a smooth finishing of the sidewall with respect of a floor or ceiling.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The lath assembly according to the invention is improved in that each keyway of the combination of laths comprises a lath stopper and in that each key member comprises a key stopper. The key stopper is integrally formed with the key member. The lath stopper is integrally formed with the lath. The connector is one single piece including the two key members and the respective two key stoppers. Initially, in an unassembled condition in which the lath assembly has separate components, the lath assembly comprises a combination of laths and a separate connector. In an assembled condition, the laths are<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> connected to each other by the connector. The key stopper is in an assembled condition in form closure with the lath stopper to lock the connector in the longitudinal direction to the lath.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The lath assembly according to the invention provides an advantage in that the engagement of the key stopper with the lath stopper provides a secure lockage of the connector to the lath in length direction. A secure lockage means that the engagement of the key stopper with the lath stopper prevents a movement of the lath with respect to the connector in a longitudinal direction. The connector is in longitudinal direction fixed in position with respect to the lath. A movement of the connector to and fro the lath in longitudinal direction is prevented by the combination of the lath and key stopper. In stead of a friction based fastening by a press fit of the key member to the lath, the lath assembly according to the invention provides a geometrically closed connection by the engagement of the respective stoppers. The engagement of the key stopper and the lath stopper provide a form closure in length direction of the laths. Typically, in an assembled condition, the laths are connected to each other under a tensional force in longitudinal direction. Once the connection is established, according to the invention, the stoppers are in engagement and cannot be easily disconnected by the tensional force in the longitudinal direction which is present in the assembled condition. Herewith, a more secure connection is provided. Due to the improved connection, occurring gaps in between connected laths are prevented. Additionally, the presented solution according to the invention makes further operative steps of applying gap filler or adhesive unnecessary.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In an embodiment of the lath assembly according to the invention, the lath assembly provides in an assembled condition a 180° connection. In particular, the lath assembly is a corner lath assembly for a sidewall edge finishing of a floor or ceiling at a corner position. The corner lath assembly comprises two connected laths which provide in an assembled condition a corner angle. In particular, the lath assembly is a mitre corner assembly, in which the laths include at least one chamfered, ie angled, end to form a mitre corner angle. The corner lath assembly provides in an assembled condition an angled connection under a corner angle of at least 60°, in particular at least 90° and at most 300°, in particular at most 270°. An internal corner means a corner in which two sidewalls enclose an angle smaller than 180°, while an external corner means a corner in which two sidewalls enclose an angle larger than 180°.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In an embodiment of the lath assembly according to the invention, the longitudinal body of the lath defines a longitudinal direction, a length direction. The longitudinal body defines a longitudinal axis, which longitudinal axis extent in the longitudinal direction. The longitudinal body has a first and second pair of opposite sides which extend in the longitudinal direction. The first pair of opposite sides defines a back and front, also called<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> outer and inner side. The second pair of the opposite sides defines a top and bottom side. When mounted to a sidewall, the back side of the lath is an inner surface of the lath which back side forms together with the bottom side of the lath a mounting surface for mounting the lath to a sidewall, floor or ceiling. The top and front side of the lath may have an ornamental appearance to provide a proper finishing work.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In an embodiment of the lath assembly according to the invention, the keyway of the lath has a receiving opening which is provided at the bottom surface of the lath. The receiving opening is configured to receive a key member of the connector. The connector is to be inserted into the receiving opening at the bottom side in a transversal direction with respect to the longitudinal direction.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Advantageously, the receiving opening at the bottom side of the lath provides a secure lockage of the connector to the lath which is less susceptible to existing tensional forces in the assembled condition. The connector is initially connected to the lath by a mounting movement which is traverse to the longitudinal direction. In an assembled condition, occurring tensional forces are directed in the longitudinal direction of the lath and hence act in a traverse direction with respect to the mounting movement connector which prevents in the assembled condition an undesired releasing of the connector from the lath.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In an embodiment of the lath assembly according to the invention, the keyway comprises a lath stopper including an elongated wall portion. In particular, the keyway comprises a slit as a lath stopper which slit extends in a transversal direction with respect to the longitudinal direction of the lath. The slit may be manufactured into lath by a milling operation onto the inner surface of the lath. Advantageously, the slit allows a mounting movement of an inserted connector in the transversal direction and provides a secure lockage of the connector in the longitudinal direction.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In an embodiment of the lath assembly according to the invention, each lath of the combination of laths has a chamfered first end face. The chamfered first end face is prefabricated. Prefabricated means that a cutting operation to obtain the chamfered first end face is performed in a factory. The lath assembly is delivered to a user including a lath having at least one chamfered end face. The prefabricated chamfered first end face is machined beforehand and makes a manual operation at a working area to obtain the chamfered first end face at the moment of assembling unnecessary. The already available prefabricated chamfered first end face provides an advantage for a user, because in practise it often appears to be difficult for many users to provide a smooth chamfered end face by themselves. Most of the times, a user is able to sew a lath to provide a right angled lath end face, but it appears to be quiet difficult to provide an inclined end face to a lath. Problems of sewing result to an askew angled end face or an outer surface of the lath which<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> is damaged in a visible zone along a cutting line. A prefabricated chamfered end face prevents such troubles.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In an embodiment of the lath assembly according to the invention, a chamfered end face of a lath comprises a chamfer angle of at least 10°, in particular at least 22,5°, preferably about 45° to create a desired corner angle by a combination of at least two laths. Two laths having a chamfered end face of about 45° may be used to form a straight corner angle. Alternatively, a plurality of laths, e.g. four laths having a chamfered angle of about 22,5°, may be used to create a work around.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In an embodiment of the lath assembly according to the invention, the combination of laths comprises a first lath and a second lath, wherein each lath has a prefabricated chamfered first end face and a right angled second end face. In dependence of the direction of the chamfered first end face, the user assembles an internal or external mitre corner. Advantageously, a mitre corner connection can be formed by using the combination of laths without a sewing operation. A user will not experience the above mentioned disadvantages or sewing. A corner assembly can be provided quickly and further laths can be quickly mounted against a sidewall to extend the corner assembly. Preferably, the first and second lath are lengthened at a prefabricated length of at least 10cm, in particular at least 20cm, but preferably at least 30cm to obtain a smooth and visual attractive corner assembly. Preferably, the first and second lath have a prefabricated length of at most 100cm, preferably at most 50cm. The prefabricated length of the lath is handsome and suffice to cover and compensate some irregularities at a sidewall. A user can simply connect the first lath to the second lath and place a further lath against a sidewall in abutting engagement with the right angled second end of respectively a first or second lath.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In an embodiment of the lath assembly according to the invention, each lath of a pair of laths has a chamfered first end face and a chamfered second end face, wherein the chamfered first end face of a lath is arranged in parallel with the chamfered second end face. With respect to a longitudinal axis of the first lath, the chamfered end faces of the first lath of the pair of laths are in mirror symmetry with the chamfered end faces of the second lath.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Advantageously, the pair of laths having parallel chamfered end faces is suitable to create selectively an internal or an external mitre corner. The chamfered end faces are prefabricated which advantageously makes a mitre sewing operation of a user redundant. A user may connect respectively a first end of the first lath with a second end of the second lath or a second end of the first end to a first end of the second lath to obtain selectively an internal or external mitre corner. Advantageously, whatever desired, the single pair of laths allows a user to create an internal or external mitre corner assembly. After determining which chamfered end faces are to be used to form the corner assembly, a user may cut the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> remaining chamfered ends from the lath to obtain right angled end faces which may provide a smooth connection with abutting laths.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In an embodiment of the lath assembly according to the invention, the laths are arranged as an ornamental lath. An ornamental lath has an outer surface which provides a decorative finishing, e.g. a smooth or wooden look-a-like finishing. The ornamental lath serves for a decorative finishing of a sidewall. In particular, the lath comprises a lath body of a soft wood, like MDF. The ornamental lath may have an inner body of soft wood which inner body is covered by a sheet material, in particular a plastic sheet material, to obtain a decorative finishing of the lath. The lath may be a floor lath, also called a plinth, to provide a finishing of a floor edge with respect to a sidewall. Alternatively, the lath may be a ceiling lath to provide a finishing of a ceiling edge with respect to a sidewall.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In an embodiment of the lath assembly according to the invention, the key member and the key stopper are rigidly connected to each other. A relative movement of the key stopper with respect to the key member is prohibited.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In an embodiment of the lath assembly according to the invention, a geometrical shape of the key member including the key stopper is configured to fit closely into a keyway including a lath stopper of a lath. Regarding a cross section, the geometrical shape of the key member including the key stopper may be substantially identical to the geometrical shape of the keyway including the lath stopper in which substantially identical means that small tolerances exist to fit the key member into the keyway. To obtain a connection of the connector to a lath, the rigid key member including the rigid key stopper is pressed into a keyway until the key stopper fits with the lath stopper. Preferably, the connector is slid into the keyway in a transverse direction with respect to the longitudinal direction of a lath. Advantageously, the rigid connection of the key stopper to the key member provides an opportunity for a user to disconnect the connector from the lath when it appears necessary. A user may unintentionally generate an internal corner assembly, while an external corner assembly is needed. In such a case, it may be an advantage to be able to easily disconnect the connector from the lath and reconnect the connector in another way again.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In an embodiment of the lath assembly according to the invention, the key member may have a geometrical shape which is configured to fit with an amount of play into a corresponding keyway. The key member is flexible which means that the key member is bendable during an introduction into the keyway. The amount of play in the keyway permits an elastic deformation of the key member during an introduction of the key member into the keyway. When the key member reaches its end position, the key stopper engages with a corresponding lath stopper by a snapping movement which provides a form closure of the key member in the keyway.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In an embodiment of the lath assembly according to the invention, the key stopper is resiliently connected to the key member. The key stopper may be a resilient portion of the key member. The resilient connection allows a relative movement of the key stopper with respect to the key member. The key stopper may be a snap portion of the key member which snaps in an assembled condition into a snap recess of a keyway which snap recess serves as a lath stopper. The resilient portion has a back position in which a prestress occurs and a snap position in which the prestress is at least partially eliminated. To get a connection of the connector to a lath, the resilient portion is held in the back position and may be pressed into a keyway of a lath. When entering the snap recess, the resilient portion will spring back into the snap position. Herewith, a lockage of the connector to the lath is achieved. The lockage is a once-only lockage which means that after the snap fit, the connector cannot be easily disconnected again. Advantageously, the snap fit is a clear indication to a user that a reliable connection is established.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In an embodiment of the lath assembly according to the invention, the keyway of the lath has a receiving opening which coincidences with the keyway opening at the end face. The receiving opening is provided at the end face of the lath. A connector is to be inserted into the receiving opening in a longitudinal direction of the lath. A snap connection may be provided to provide a form closure connection of the connector to the lath. Advantageously, a secure lockage is provided in an easy way.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In an embodiment of the lath assembly according to the invention, each key member comprises at least one key stopper. The at least one key stopper may be situated at an inner and/or outer surface of the key member. The key stopper may be formed by a protrusion which extends in a direction away from the inner or outer surface. In particular, the protrusion extends in a direction substantially perpendicular to the key member. The protrusion may have any geometrical shape which is suitable to withstand occurring tensional forces in an assembled condition of the lath assembly in which the forces are directed in a longitudinal direction of a lath. The protrusion may have e.g. a circular or longitudinal shape.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In an embodiment of the lath assembly according to the invention, the protrusion of the key stopper has a longitudinal shape, wherein the lath stopper comprises a corresponding longitudinal shape. The lath stopper and key stopper may have an elongated wall portion. The lath stopper may be formed by a slit in a keyway. In particular, the protrusion has a longitudinal shape which extends in a plane defined by a plate body of the key member in a direction which is in an assembled condition traverse to a longitudinal direction of a lath. Advantageously, the longitudinal shape of the key stopper and lath stopper provides a smooth distribution of introduced tensional forces in the assembled condition of the lath assembly. The smooth distribution prevents a depression of a stopper<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> surface of a lath stopper which might result in an elimination of a pressing force and open gap at a mitre corner connection. Herewith, the protrusion as a key stopper is suitable to compensate tensional forces existing in the assembled condition, such that a possible gap in between two connected laths is closed by a pressing force.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">In an embodiment of the lath assembly according to the invention, the first key member of the connector comprises an inner and an outer surface, wherein both inner and outer surface are provided with respectively an inner and outer key stopper. Preferably, both first and second key members are provided with an inner and outer key stopper. Both sides of the first key member are provided with a key stopper. In an assembled condition, tensional forces occur which are directed in a longitudinal direction of the lath. The key member which comprises at both sides a key stopper which provides advantageously and improved introduction of the tensional forces into the key member. The tensional forces are symmetrically introduced into the key member. Introduced tensional forces into the key member hardly generate a torque onto the key member which reduces bending forces and increases the reliability of the provided connection by the connector.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In an embodiment of the lath assembly according to the invention the key stopper comprises an upstanding wall portion having a substantially constant wall thickness. Advantageously, the connector can be easily produced into one piece by thermoforming.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In an embodiment of the local assembly according to the invention, the key member of the connector comprises a plate body, wherein the place body of the key member is rounded at an outer corner. A rounded corner provides an insertion portion to the key member. The corner of the key member may be rounded by a radius of at least 5 mm, in particular at least 10 mm, but preferably at least 15mm. Advantageously, the rounded corner of the key member allows a more convenient insertion into a receiving opening of a keyway of a lath.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">In an embodiment of the local assembly according to the invention, the inner and/or outer surface of the key member are textured. The textured surface may e.g. be ribbed. In stead of a smooth surface, the textured surface provide a rough surface which may improve a frictional engagement of the connector with the lath. In use, the improved frictional engagement may be convenient in a preparing step of mounting a lath assembly in which no final lockage is made. The preparing step can for example be performed to determine whether the lath assembly satisfies the needs of a user. The improved frictional engagement by the textured surfaces may prevent an undesired release of a lath assembly during the preparing step. If the lath assembly satisfies, the lath assembly can be locked in a subsequent step by engaging the key stopper with the lath stopper. Such an approach may especially be satisfying when the stoppers are arranged as a only-once lockage.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0035" num="0035">In an embodiment of the lath assembly according to the invention, the connector is an angled connector for providing an angled connection of two laths.

The first and second plate body are angled connected to each other in which the second plate body defines a plane which extends in a direction under an acute angle with respect of a plane defined by the first plate body. The second key member extends in an angled, in particular substantially orthogonal, direction with respect to the first key member. Due to the plate shaped key members, the angled connector provides rigidity to assembled laths. The angled connector is suitable to connect upstanding laths, in particular plinths, along a sidewall.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In an embodiment of the lath assembly according to the invention, the connector is a flat connector for providing a connection of two laths which are flat positioned in one common plane. The flat connector is suitable to connect flat positioned floor laths, also called cover plinths, or ceiling laths to each other. Flat positioned means that the lath which has a length, height and width is a flat lath having a smaller height than width, in which the width of the flat lath is positioned in a plane. A mounting surface of the flat lath is provided in width direction. The flat connector is a planar connector. The flat connector has a plate shape connector body.
