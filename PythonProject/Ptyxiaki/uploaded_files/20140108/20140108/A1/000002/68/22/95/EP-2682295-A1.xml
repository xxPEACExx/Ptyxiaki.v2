The urging mechanism has an increase rate of the urging force at an initial stroke, which pushes the rod into the case, less than an increase rate of the urging force at a later stroke following the initial stroke.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In the aforementioned aspect, the urging mechanism positioned between the tube-shaped case fixed to the auto body side facing the fuel lid and the rod slidably held inside the case and protruding from the inside of the case so as to push out the fuel lid, is compressed by the elastic deformation inside the case so as to urge the rod in the direction protruding from the inside of the case. Also, the urging mechanism has the increase rate of the urging force at the initial stroke, which pushes the rod into the case, less than the increase rate of the urging force at the later stroke following the initial stroke. Consequently, when the fuel lid is being closed, and the fuel lid abuts against the push-up device, a reaction force of the urging mechanism of the push-up device, which pushes back the fuel lid, is small at an initial stage, and after that increases. As a result, when the fuel lid is being closed, flapping of the fuel lid caused by the fuel lid pushed back is controlled by the reaction force of the urging mechanism of the push-up device so as to improve operability.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">As for a second aspect of the present invention, in the first aspect of the present invention, the urging mechanism may be a coil spring including a large pitch portion and a small pitch portion, which have different pitches.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In the aforementioned aspect, the urging mechanism is the coil spring including the large pitch portion and the small pitch portion, which have different pitches, so that one coil spring can be used for the urging mechanism so as to simplify a configuration.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">As for a third aspect of the present invention, in the second aspect of the present invention, the small pitch portion may be formed in both end portions of the coil spring in a longitudinal direction.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In the aforementioned aspect, the small pitch portions formed in both end portions of the coil spring in the longitudinal direction abut against the case and the rod. Consequently, when the coil spring is compressed, both end portions of the coil spring in the longitudinal direction are difficult to curve relative to the longitudinal direction.

Consequently, due to a disengagement of the engagement between the stationary side cam 72 and the movable side cam portion 82, the rotator 22 rotates in the arrow B direction in <figref idrefs="f0008">Fig. 9B</figref>, and moves toward the first slope face<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> portion 52A of the lock groove 52 from the lower side of the slide groove 50.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">Next, when the force pushing the rod 20 in is released, the rotator 22 is pushed up by the compression restoring force of the coil spring 26. At that time, the engagement protrusion 56 abuts against the first slope face portion 52A. Consequently, the engagement protrusion 56 ascends while slidingly contacting the first slope face portion 52A, and as shown in <figref idrefs="f0009">Fig. 10B</figref>, the engagement protrusion 56 fits in the lock portion 52B so as to return to the lock state again.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">Thus, in the present embodiment, the lock mechanism is a rotating cam type lock mechanism, and by pushing the rod 20 in, a rotating cam operates so as to switch between the locking and the unlocking. Consequently, a switchover between the locking and the unlocking is ensured.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">Also, in the present embodiment, one coil spring 26 including the large pitch portion 26A and the small pitch portions 26B and 26C is used as the urging mechanism so as to simplify a configuration. As a result, a cost increase can be controlled.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">Also, in the present embodiment, the small pitch portions 26B and 26C formed in both end portions in the longitudinal direction of the coil spring 26 abut against the case 16 and the rod 20. Consequently, when the coil spring 26 is compressed, both the end portions in the longitudinal direction of the coil spring 26 are difficult to curve relative to the longitudinal direction. As a result, a compression deformation of the whole coil spring 26 stabilizes.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">Also, in the present embodiment, in the state wherein the coil spring 26 is compressed, and the small pitch<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> portions 26B and 26C, compressed following the large pitch portion 26A, are compressed leaving the unlocking push-in amount (S5 - S4) of the rod 20, i.e., in the state wherein the small pitch portions 26B and 26C of the coil spring 26 are nearly attached firmly, the lock mechanism locks the rod 20 in the retracted position of the case 16. Consequently, the urging force of the coil spring 26 in the lock state wherein the rod 20 is locked in the retracted position of the case 16 increases so as to control the rod 20 in the lock state and the flapping of the fuel lid 12.</p><heading id="h0020">(Another embodiment)</heading><p id="p0079" num="0079">Although the specific embodiment of the present invention has been explained in detail hereinabove, the present invention is not limited to the aforementioned embodiment, and it is obvious for those skilled in the art to have other various embodiments within a range of the present invention. For example, as in a case of a push-up device 90 of a second embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0021">Fig. 24</figref>, a rod 102 is pushed into a case 100, so that an end portion 108A of a control spring 108 moves along a heart-shaped control cam 106, and the end portion 108A of the control spring 108 is locked at a concave portion 106A of a control cam 106 so as to become a lock state. The rod 102 is pushed into the case 100 again, so that the end portion 108A of the control spring 108 comes out of the concave portion 106A of the control cam 106 so as to release the lock state. Using as it is called a heart cam type push-up device (a push-up device described in German Patent No. <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="DE19650594A1"><text>19650594A1</text></patcit> and the like), there may be used a configuration using the coil spring 26 of the first embodiment as the urging mechanism urging the rod 102 in a direction protruding from an inside of the case 100.<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --></p><p id="p0080" num="0080">Also, each embodiment described hereinabove has a configuration in which the small pitch portions 26B and 26C of the coil spring 26 are formed in both end portions in the longitudinal direction of the coil spring 26, and the intermediate portion in the longitudinal direction of the coil spring 26 is the large pitch portion 26A. However, provided that the coil spring 26 forms a small pitch portion and a large pitch portion, which have different pitches, the number or positions of the small pitch portion and the large pitch portion are not limited to each embodiment described hereinabove.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">Also, by partially changing a width or a material of the coil spring 26, for example, by widening the small pitch portions 26B and 26C of the coil spring 26 compared to a width of the large pitch portion 26A, or by strengthening an elastic force of a material forming the small pitch portions 26B and 26C of the coil spring 26 compared to an elastic force of a material forming the large pitch portion 26A, there may be a configuration wherein the increase rate of the urging force at the initial stroke, which pushes the rod into the case, is reduced compared to an increase rate of the urging force at the later stroke following the initial stroke.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">Also, in each embodiment described hereinabove, the coil spring 26 is used as the urging mechanism. However, instead of the coil spring, there may be used, for example, another urging mechanism to which a columnar rubber having a different elastic force is connected so as to reduce the increase rate of the urging force at the initial stroke, which pushes the rod into the case, compared to the increase rate of the urging force at the later stroke following the initial stroke.</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56983018" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A push-up device, comprising:
