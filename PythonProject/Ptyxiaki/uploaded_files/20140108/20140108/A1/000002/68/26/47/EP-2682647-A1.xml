A lockup clutch LC that joins the impeller 12 to the turbine 13 includes a lockup piston 16 that is disposed in a space between a back face of the turbine 13 and the torque converter cover 11, the space being divided by the lockup piston 16 into a lockup release chamber 17 on the torque converter cover 11 side and a lockup tightening chamber 18 on the turbine 13 side. The lockup piston 16 can slide in the axial direction of the torque converter TC and can rotate together with the turbine 13.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The interior of the torque converter TC is filled with hydraulic oil supplied from a lockup release chamber inlet 19 and a lockup tightening chamber inlet 20, and when the impeller 12 is rotated by the crankshaft of the engine via the torque converter cover 11 to make the hydraulic oil circulate, the turbine 13 receives the dynamic pressure and is driven, and the input shaft of the transmission rotates. In this process, due to the action of blades of<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> the impeller 12, the turbine 13, and the stator 15 the torque of the impeller 12 is amplified and transmitted to the turbine 13, but even under running conditions in which the impeller 12 and the turbine 13 rotate at the same speed, since power transmission is via hydraulic oil, it is impossible to avoid the occurrence of a certain degree of power transmission loss. Therefore, the lockup clutch LC is engaged to integrally join the impeller 12 and the turbine 13, and the occurrence of power transmission loss is thus avoided.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Engagement and disengagement of the lockup clutch LC is carried out by supplying an oil pressure selectively to the lockup release chamber 17 and the lockup tightening chamber 18. That is, when an oil pressure is supplied from the lockup tightening chamber inlet 20 to the lockup tightening chamber 18 a friction material 21 of the lockup piston 16 abuts against the torque converter cover 11 to thus engage the lockup clutch LC, and rotation of the crankshaft is transmitted directly to the input shaft via the torque converter cover 11 and the lockup piston 16. On the other hand, when an oil pressure is supplied from the lockup release chamber inlet 19 to the lockup release chamber 17 the friction material 21 of the lockup piston 16 becomes detached from the torque converter cover 11 to thus release engagement of the lockup clutch LC, and rotation of the crankshaft is transmitted to the input shaft via the torque converter cover 11, the impeller 12, the hydraulic oil, and the turbine 13.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">A lockup clutch control device that controls engagement and disengagement of the lockup clutch LC includes a hydraulic pump 23 that supplies hydraulic oil within a hydraulic oil tank 22, supply pressure adjustment means 24 that adjusts the pressure of the hydraulic oil supplied from the hydraulic pump 23, hydraulic circuit switching means 25 that selectively supplies the pressure-adjusted oil pressure to the lockup release chamber 17 and the lockup tightening chamber 18, tightening force adjustment means 26 that controls the oil pressure supplied to the lockup release chamber 17, and signal pressure generation means 27 that generates a signal pressure for controlling the tightening force control means 26. Therefore, it is possible to control the oil pressure of the lockup release chamber 17 by the tightening force adjustment means 26, control the oil pressure of the lockup tightening chamber 18 by the supply pressure adjustment means 24, and carry out switching control of the supplied oil<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> pressure by the hydraulic circuit switching means 25, thereby enabling the tightening force of the lockup clutch LC to be freely controlled.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In a state in which an oil temperature To of the hydraulic oil of the transmission is low, the viscosity of the hydraulic oil becomes high and operation of the lockup clutch LC becomes unstable, and it is therefore necessary to restrict engagement of the lockup clutch LC. Furthermore, in a state in which a water temperature Tw of cooling water of the engine before warming up is complete is low, the idling rotational speed is set high, and it is therefore necessary to restrict engagement of the lockup clutch LC. In this process, if engagement of the lockup clutch LC is restricted unnecessarily, it might cause degradation of the fuel economy, and it is therefore desirable to minimize restrictions on the engagement of the lockup clutch LC.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Because of this, in the present embodiment, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref>, an electronic control unit U that controls engagement and disengagement of the lockup clutch LC includes temperature comparison means M1, engagement permission means M2, and control region determination means M3. Connected to the temperature comparison means M1 are a water temperature sensor Sa that detects the water temperature Tw of the cooling water of the engine and an oil temperature sensor Sb that detects the oil temperature To of the hydraulic oil of the transmission. Connected to the control region determination means M3 are a vehicle speed sensor Sc that detects a vehicle speed V and an accelerator pedal opening degree sensor Sd that detects an opening degree θ of an accelerator pedal.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The temperature comparison means M1 compares the water temperature Tw and the oil temperature To with predetermined threshold values, and based on the results thereof the engagement permission means M2 permits engagement of the lockup clutch LC. The control region determination means M3 determines, based on the vehicle speed V and the opening degree θ of the accelerator pedal, a control region for controlling engagement of the lockup clutch LC, that is, a feedback region, a tight region, and a fixed region. As shown in <figref idrefs="f0005">FIG. 5</figref>, the feedback region is a region in which oil pressure supplied to the lockup clutch LC is subjected to feedback control so that the slip rate of the lockup clutch LC becomes a predetermined value. The tight region is a region in which oil pressure supplied to the lockup<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> clutch LC is fixed to a maximum value so that the lockup clutch LC is completely engaged. The fixed region is a region in which there is no target slip rate, and feedforward control of supplying a precalculated oil pressure to the lockup clutch LC is carried out.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The operation is now explained in further detail by reference to <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 2</figref> and the flowchart of <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref>.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">First, in Step S1 of the main routine of <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 3</figref> the water temperature Tw of the cooling water of the engine is detected by the water temperature sensor Sa, if in Step S2 the water temperature Tw is at least a first set temperature T1 (e.g. 80°C), that is, warming up of the engine is completed or substantially completed and an idling rotational speed becomes low, it is determined that the running conditions of the engine are stabilized, and in Step S3 engagement of the lockup clutch LC is permitted.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">If in Step S1 above the water temperature Tw is less than the first set temperature T1 and in Step S4 the oil temperature sensor Sb is not malfunctioning, then in Step S5 the water temperature Tw of the cooling water of the engine is detected by the water temperature sensor Sa, and the oil temperature To of the hydraulic oil of the transmission is detected by the oil temperature sensor Sb. If in Step S6 the water temperature Tw is less than the first set temperature T1 and at least a second set temperature T2 (e.g. 60°C) and the oil temperature To is at least a third set temperature T3 (e.g. 50°C), then in Step S3 above engagement of the lockup clutch LC is permitted.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">At the second set temperature T2 (= 60°C), which is lower than the first set temperature T1 (= 80°C), the state is one in which warming up of the engine is not yet completed and the idling rotational speed is high to some degree.
