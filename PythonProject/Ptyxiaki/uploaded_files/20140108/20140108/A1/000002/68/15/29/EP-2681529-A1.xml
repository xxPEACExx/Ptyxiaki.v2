</p><p id="p0002" num="0002"> [0001] The invention relates to a device and a method for porosity measurement, and a control arrangement and a control method based thereon. </p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Background </p><p id="p0004" num="0004"> [0002] Paper contains fibres and various fines and filler particles, which are tightly compressed when the paper is made. Between particles, and often also inside fibres, there are still tiny air channels and cavities, which render the paper porous. </p><p id="p0005" num="0005"> [0003] Porosity of paper may be defined, for instance, by measuring air permeability of paper, for which there are several standardized measurement methods, such as ISO 5636-1 , ISO 5636-2, ISO 5636-3 and 5636-4. The measurement may be carried out as on-line measurement on a moving paper web during the manufacturing of paper, or as off-line measurement on an immovable sample of paper in the laboratory. </p><p id="p0006" num="0006"> [0004] In most standards of the paper field the measurement is performed by means of low pressure in such a manner that a low-pressure generator generates the low pressure between a measuring head and the paper. The low pressure is measured by a sensor and in the measurement it is of importance that through pressure measurement the low-pressure generator will be controlled to produce a predetermined constant low pressure, which is accurately defined in the standard, between the measuring head and the paper. When said predetermined low pressure is achieved, a flow rate of gas through paper will be measured towards the low-pressure generator. As the pressure of gas is made constant, a change in the porosity of paper will change the flow rate of gas (ml/min). Consequently, the porosity of paper may be determined by the measured flow rate of gas. </p><p id="p0007" num="0007"> [0005] Current on-line meters are manufactured in compliance with these laboratory methods for measurement. However, the standard on-line measurement thereof involves problems. A predetermined constant pressure for determining a flow rate of air is difficult to provide and maintain accurately, particularly in on-line measurement, in which both the paper and the measuring head move continuously. Inaccuracy of pressure control and uncontrollable variation in low pressure reduce the accuracy of measurement. To obtain a 
<!-- EPO <DP n="4"/>-->
 predetermined pressure requires continuous regulation, which causes a delay in the measurement. The continuous regulation of the measuring pressure wears a regulator which controls the low-pressure generator and which needs to be replaced by a new one in about every six months, for instance, due to wearing and breaking. </p><p id="p0008" num="0008"> [0006] In addition, any low-pressure pump incorporating moving mechanical parts is sensitive to dirt and dust. Dirt and dust disturb the operation of the pump and may even block the pump, because they adhere to the mechanical parts of the pump. Moisture makes things worse, because in that case dirt and dust stick to the mechanical parts even more easily and tightly. Moisture as such also impedes the operation of the pump, because moisture or condensed water may cause short-circuits, malfunctions and/or damages in the electrical components. The moving mechanical parts may also suffer from moisture. The operation of the pump being disturbed, the measurement of porosity becomes more difficult or it will be impossible to measure it at all. A conventional flow meter, which is based on filament resistance, is also sensitive to moisture and dust, because the filament resistance depends on moisture and dust. The filament is also easily broken because of moisture and dust. For these reasons, inter alia, the measuring device employs one or more filters, which are to prevent access of moisture and dust into the measuring device. Filtering is not completely thorough, however, and thus pumps and flow meters break down due to moisture and dirt. Apart from the filter impeding the air flow and thus deteriorating the accuracy of measurement, the filter fouls very quickly, for instance, when porosity is to be measured prior to coating in moist conditions. Thus, the filter is to be changed or emptied often at least once a day, which interrupts the porosity measurement and requires resources. Finally, it may further be stated that when measurement is performed on extremely dense paper, the flow rate is so low that the measurement thereof poses problems. For these reasons, inter alia, there is a need to develop porosity measurement. </p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Brief description </p><p id="p0010" num="0010"> [0007] The object of the invention is to provide an improved solution.

 board, constituting the object of measurement 116, by exposing the paper or the board to a known and/or predetermined suction effect and by measuring the low pressure produced by the suction effect, the value of which is based on porosity. In this context the predetermined suction effect I refers to a quaantity that may observe a predetermined function F, dependent on flow rate q and low pressure P, such that I = F(q, P). In a simple case, the predetermined function F may be a product of the flow rate and the pressure F(q, P) = aqP, where a is a constant that may be determined experimentally, for instance. </p><p id="p0031" num="0031"> [0015] The measuring device may comprise a pressure generator 102 and a sensor 104. The measuring device may thus determine the porosity of the paper or board, constituting the object of measurement 1 16, by directing suction with the pressure generator 102 at a predetermined strength to the object of measurement 116 and by measuring the low pressure produced by said suction with the sensor 104. </p><p id="p0032" num="0032"> [0016] The low pressure P may be determined by a pressure difference over the object to be measured 16. In that case, in the surroundings 1 18 of the object of measurement 1 16, where normal atmospheric pressure often prevails, the pressure is higher than on that side of the object of measurement 116 where low pressure is measured with the sensor 104. In this document the low pressure may refer to a pressure difference over the object of measurement 116 or a pressure that is measured with the sensor 104. For determining the low pressure it is also possible to measure the ambient pressure 118, or it may be assumed known. </p><p id="p0033" num="0033"> [0017] Generally, the measuring device may comprise at least one measuring head 100, at least one pressure generator 102 and at least one sensor 104. The measuring head 100, the outer surface of whose contact part 1 10 is intended to be in contact with the object of measurement 116, may incorporate a measuring space 106, but a separate measuring space 106, in particular, is not necessary. Particularly, there is no separate measuring space 106, if, for instance, the pressure generator 102 communicates directly with at least one port 112 of the contact part 1 10. In that case the pressure generator 102 may be connected to at least one port 12 directly or, for instance, through at least one gas conduit 150. </p><p id="p0034" num="0034"> [0018] The surface 1 14 of the measuring head 100 may be made of material impermeable to gas. The material may be metal, for instance. The contact part 110 may be made of e.g. steel, ceramics, diamond, sapphire or a 
<!-- EPO <DP n="7"/>-->
 combination thereof. The material of the contact part 110 may be a combination of metal and ceramics, for instance, in which case the steel may constitute the body and the ceramics may constitute the outer surface in order to reduce wearing. The object of measurement 116 may be paper, board or a combination thereof. </p><p id="p0035" num="0035"> [0019] When the measuring head 100 comprises a measuring space 106, the surface 114 comprises a pressure opening 108 for gas flow between the pressure generator 102 and the measuring space 106. The measuring head 100 and the pressure generator 102 may be directly interconnected, but between the measuring head 100 and the pressure generator 102 there may also be a gas conduit 150 for gas flow (shown e.g. in Figure 2), one end of which is connected to the pressure opening 108 of the measuring head and the other end to the pressure generator 102. The gas conduit 150 may be a pipe and its material may be metal or plastic, for instance. The surface of the gas conduit 150 may be coated with soil-repellent materials. The pressure opening 108 or the port 112 and the pressure generator 102 may be conceived to also comprise an appropriate connector for each gas pipe. </p><p id="p0036" num="0036"> [0020] In its contact part 110 the measuring head 100 comprises at least one port 112, through which the gas may flow after passing through the object of measurement 1 16. The total area of one or more ports 112 may be predetermined, for instance, for the measurement in accordance with a desired standard. The area of one or more ports 1 12 may also be adjustable. </p><p id="p0037" num="0037"> [0021] The pressure generator 102 is intended to work at a predetermined operating efficiency. The pressure generator 102 is a gas pump which is capable of providing a gas flow of predetermined magnitude when <sub>^</sub>operating with unchanged efficiency against known flow resistance. The known pressure may be low pressure produced in relation to the pressure prevailing on the opposite side 118 of the object of measurement 116. The higher the flow resistance, through which the pressure generator 102 pumps gas, the lower the gas flow the pressure generator produces, yet the interdependence of the gas flow and the pressure is predetermined all the time. It is conceivable that the constant power P of the pressure generator may be expressed as P = Δρς, where Δρ is a pressure difference over the object of measurement 116 acting as resistance and q is a gas flow rate. Thus, the flow rate q will be q = Ρ/Δρ. This, in turn may be expressed as q = P/(p<sub>0</sub> - p<sub>m</sub>), because Δρ = p<sub>0</sub> - p<sub>m</sub>, where p<sub>m</sub> is a measured pressure, po is a known pressure (e.g. atmospheric 
<!-- EPO <DP n="8"/>-->
 pressure or pressure in a gas container on the opposite side 118 of the object of measurement 1 6). The flow rate curve would thus be a hyperbola, yet an ejector, for instance, has the highest possible flow rate Q<sub>max</sub>. In addition, in the ejector, for instance, the flow rate behaves mostly linearly in relation to the pressure difference Δρ, for instance, q = a(P)Ap, where a(P) is a coefficient depending on the pressure P. Generally, the flow rate q may be expressed by a predetermined formula q = ί(Δρ), where f is a known function. The function f may be based on a theory, simulation or measurements. So, if the pressure p<sub>m</sub> provided by the pressure generator 102 is measured, it is also possible to determine the amount of gas flow provided by the pressure generator 102 (e.g. in unit cm<sup>3</sup>/min), when a predetermined operating efficiency P is used in the pressure generator 102. The operating efficiency refers here to the capability of the pressure generator of moving or sucking gas out of each flow channel 112. The pressure generator 102 thus draws gas away from the object of measurement at a predetermined suction force, whereby gas flows through the porous object of measurement 116 in the larger amount, the more porous the object of measurement 116. </p><p id="p0038" num="0038"> [0022] In the presented solution, the pumping of the pressure generator 102 is resisted by the object of measurement 116, and the amount of gas flow passing therethrough is proportionate to the porosity of the object of measurement. The gas flow through the object of measurement 1 16 and the predetermined operating efficiency of the pressure generator 102 thus provide an equilibrium in which a low pressure depending on the porosity of the object of measurement 116 prevails between the contact part 110 and the pressure generator 102. The low pressure means that the pressure in each flow channel 1 12 is lower than elsewhere around 1 18 the object of measurement 116, where, for instance, a normal atmospheric pressure of about 101 kPa may prevail. </p><p id="p0039" num="0039"> [0023] In an embodiment, the pressure generator 102, which may comprise an ejector or an electromechanical low-pressure pump, for instance, sucks gas towards itself and thus directs low pressure at a predetermined operating efficiency to each flow channel 1 12 of the measuring head 100. Between the pump and the object of measurement it is possible to place a throttle, by means of which the operating efficiency of the device may be controlled. The low pressure acts on the object of measurement 1 16 placed against the contact part 1 10 of the measuring head 100. In case the object of measure- 
<!-- EPO <DP n="9"/>-->
 ment 116 is not highly porous, but it strongly resists the flow of gas therethrough, the low pressure is high. In case the object of measurement 1 16 is highly porous and allows gas to pass easily through, the low pressure remains low. Thus, the magnitude of low pressure depends on the gas flow taking place through the object of measurement 116 and the port 112. </p><p id="p0040" num="0040"> [0024] The porosity of the object of measurement may be determined with a sensor 104 by measuring the pressure prevailing in at least one port 1 2 in the measuring head 100. Pressure measurement may be performed in a measuring space 106, for instance. The sensor 104 may be an electronic sensor 104. A computing unit 206 (i.a. Figure 2) may be part of a processor-based system controller, for instance. For instance, a MEMS (Mi- croElectroMechanical System) sensor converts pressure to an electric signal. The MEMS sensor is like a capacitor whose capacitance changes according to the pressure exerted thereon. The electric signal based on capacitance may be applied to the computing unit 206 for signal processing and/or to a display. An electric analogue signal may be converted to a digital one prior to the signal processing and/or the display. The computing unit 206, in turn, may be a computer with appropriate software, for instance. On the paper machine, the computing unit 206 may also be part of the system controller controlling the operation of the paper machine (cf. Figure 7). </p><p id="p0041" num="0041"> [0025] When measurement of porosity is performed by measuring pressure, it is possible to avoid direct measurement of gas flow which poses problems in prior art measurements of porosity. At the same time, it is possible to avoid problems caused by the sensitivity of flow meters to dust and moisture. Because flow meters that are prone to faults due to dust and moisture are no longer needed, dust and moisture filters are hot needed either. In measurements, which are not to be performed at constant pressure, there is no need for continuous pressure control, and therefore a valve controlling pressure is not needed, or pressure control is needed infrequently, so the pressure control valve needs to be changed only infrequently, or it is not needed at all. Because many parts are reduced in number, the size and the mass of the measuring device are smaller than in prior art. This has a lowering effect on the manufacturing costs as well. </p><p id="p0042" num="0042"> [0026] Figure B shows an embodiment including, for instance, two flow channels 1 12, and the pressure generator 102 is connected to each one separately through gas conduits 150, for instance.

Each drain hole 200 may drain gas to each port 112. The size of the hole 200 may be adjustable. When the size of each hole 200 (surface area) is known and when the pressure in the measuring space 106 is known, the amount of flow passing through said at least one hole 200 is also known. The measuring device may also comprise a valve 202, which allows the drain hole 200 to be opened and closed, but the drain valve 202 is not necessary. Each drain hole 200 may be used in this manner for producing a desired low pressure in each flow channel 112. Different ports 112 may have different low pressures. In addition, each bypass flow to be produced via the drain hole 200 may contribute to keep the measuring device 100 and its components clean. By means of the bypass flow it is also possible to achieve a sufficiently high flow rate of pure gas into the pressure generator 112 (e.g. into the ejector of Figure 3) to keep it clean. The sensor 104 in each port may measure the pressure and the computing unit 206 may receive the signal generated by the sensor 104 and determine the porosity of the object of measurement 1 6 on the basis of the pressure data of each port 1 12. </p><p id="p0044" num="0044"> [0028] Figure 2 shows the measuring arrangement in more detail.

The sensor 104 may measure pressure in the gas conduit 150, instead of the actual measuring space 106, because the pressure in the gas conduit 150 is the same as or proportional to the pressure in the measuring space 106. The measuring sensor 104 generates a signal that contains pressure data.

The predetermined function may be a sine function, for instance. The computing unit 206 receives the signal generated by the measuring sensor 104 and determines the porosity of the object of measurement 116 on the basis of a varying low pressure. Because a varying pressure range that behaves in a predetermined manner is available, the measurement is more accurate than the measurement performed by means of constant pressure. For instance, it is possible to detect whether the porosity changes linearly or non-linearly in relation to the low pressure. </p><p id="p0046" num="0046"> [0030] Figure 3 shows an embodiment, in which the pressure generator 102 may comprise an electropneumatic transducer 302. The pressure generator 102 may also comprise an ejector 300. There may be a plurality of electropneumatic transducers and ejectors, and one electropneumatic transducer may supply pressure to more than one ejector. Generally defined, the ejector comprises a flow-through pipe with an interfitting pipe to a T-branch. When gas is flown through the ejector, suction is provided in the T-branch. The electropneumatic transducer 302 may supply gas or liquid at a predetermined pressure to the ejector 300, so that the ejector 300 will operate at a predetermined operating efficiency with different amounts of suction. The electropneumatic transducer 302 may receive gas at a pressure of e.g. 600 kPa, and the electropneumatic transducer 302 may supply gas into the ejector 300 at a pressure which may be any constant pressure in the range of 110 kPa to 600 kPa, for instance. In addition, the electropneumatic transducer 302 may control the predetermined gas pressure so as to control the predetermined operating efficiency of the ejector 300. The pressure generated by the electropneumatic transducer 302 may be measured with a pressure gauge 304 and thus the pressure may be controlled to be as desired.

 Bendtsen porosity measurement. In that case, when gas flow is measured by a flow meter 130, the porosity measurement may be performed according to the standard. Yet the determination of a porosity value does not require the flow meter 130, nor the result of flow measurement, because measurement of pressure in the measuring space 106 will be sufficient to determine the porosity as well as the amount of gas flow, because the flow rate depends on the pressure in the measuring cell 106 (measurable) and the operating efficiency of the pressure generator 300 (predetermined/known). In a measurement of this kind it is possible to alter the pressure produced by the ejector 300 by controlling the supply pressure of the electropneumatic transducer 302 to the ejector 300. The measurement performed by the ejector 300 has an advantage that filtering of dirt, dust and moisture is not necessarily needed. First, the flow meter and the relating filament need not be protected from dirt, dust and moisture. Further, because the ejector 300 does not comprise moving mechanical parts, nor electronic components or parts, the ejector 300 need not be protected from dirt, dust and moisture accompanying the gas that flows through the ejector 300. Namely, dirt and dust are not able to deposit on the ejector 300. The moisture alone does not disturb the operation of the measuring device either, because the gas flow takes the moisture with it and does not affect the operation of the ejector 300 or the measuring device. In addition, ejectors may be made for different flow rates and pressures, and commercially available ejectors are manufactured for different flow rates and pressures. By changing the ejector the measurement is easily scalable for various porosity ranges: for low porosities there are employed ejectors for low flow rates, whereas for high flow rates it is possible to select an ejector through which more air may flow. </p><p id="p0048" num="0048"> [0032] The ejector 300 may be brought to produce in the measuring space 106 a pressure that varies in a predetermined manner by altering the output pressure of the electropneumatic transducer 302 in a predetermined manner.

The calibration valve 402, in turn, may open a connection to at least one reference opening 404, the size of which is predetermined, in order to enable gas flow from the reference opening 404 towards the pressure generator 102. Because the size of the reference opening 404 is predetermined, the magnitude of the gas flow passing therethrough in relation to the pressure difference over the reference opening 404 (the operating efficiency of the pressure generator 102) is known. The pressure between the calibration valve 402 and the pressure generator 102 may be measured with a sensor 104. The computing unit 206 may correct the transformation by which the result of porosity measurement is obtained from the pressure, in case the measured pressure deviates from the known pressure more than what is predetermined.

Alternatively, the gap 504 and at least one suction hole 512 may form, for instance, two straight grooves on different sides of said at least one port 1 12 of the contact part 1 0. The nozzle gap 502 may provide a kind of surface current nozzle.

For instance, the size and proportions of the measuring device and the measuring head may vary greatly. For instance, it may be possible that the measuring head 100 extends throughout the entire width of the object of measurement.

In addition to this, it is clear that the operation of a paper machine is known per se to a person skilled in the art, and therefore, it need not be presented in greater detail in this context. </p><p id="p0072" num="0072"> [0052] The system controller 928, which may perform signal processing, may control various process of the paper machine on the basis of the measured pressure such that porosity in the paper to be manufactured, together with other properties, will meet the set requirements. The system controller 928 may also present the measured porosity value graphically and/or numerically on a desired scale and according to a desired standard on a display, for instance. </p><p id="p0073" num="0073"> [0053] In an embodiment, the thickness of the object of measurement 16, 10 may be determined on the basis of the measured porosity. In that case, the computing unit 206 may know in advance the basis weight of the object of measurement 116, 10, or the computing unit 206 may receive information on the basis weight of the object of measurement 1 6, 10. The basis weight may be measured by means of β radiation or optical radiation dampening. When the computing unit 206 simultaneously receives information on the measured pressure, which depends on the porosity of the object of measurement 116, 10, the thickness of the object of measurement 116, 10 may be determined as a function of the basis weight and the measured pressure or the determined porosity. The measurement of thickness is based on the fact that the density of the object of measurement 116, 10 corresponds to the basis weight divided by thickness. Bulk, in turn, is an inverse of density, and in certain conditions the bulk and the porosity correlate excellently. Thus, in principle, the thickness of the object of measurement is the product of the basis weight and the porosity. Generally, the thickness of the object of measurement 
<!-- EPO <DP n="21"/>-->
 116, 10 may be defined by a predetermined function, the arguments of which include the basis weight and the porosity (or measured pressure). The predetermined function may be defined experimentally, for instance. In test measurements conducted the thickness of the object of measurement 1 6, 0 could be measured very accurately. </p><p id="p0074" num="0074"> [0054] In an embodiment, on the basis of the determined thickness it is also possible to determine the opacity of the paper, because the opacity and the thickness are basically opposites to one another in such a way that as the thickness increases, the opacity decreases, and vice versa. The measurement of opacity may be made more accurate, if additionally moisture and/or ash distribution in the paper are measured, because the moisture and the ash distribution of the paper affect the opacity. </p><p id="p0075" num="0075"> [0055] In an embodiment, the thickness of paper may be measured by means of opacity. The measurement of thickness performed in this manner may also be made more accurate, if additionally the moisture and/or ash distribution of the paper are also measured. </p><p id="p0076" num="0076"> [0056] Figure 9 also shows a control arrangement of a paper machine. Factors affecting the porosity of paper include, inter alia, the number and mutual proportion of partial stocks, the amount of filler, the amount of retention agent, machine speed, the amount of white water and drying capacity. On the basis of the pressure data or the determined porosity, the system controller 928 may control various actuators, which may include, for instance, dispensing of partial stocks by means of valves 930, dispensing of each filler TA by means of valves 938A to 938B, dispensing of retention agent RA by means of valve 936, adjustment of the size of slice opening 908, adjustment of machine speed, control of the amount of white water and the drying processes in block 914. The system controller 928 may receive the signal from the measuring device components 916 to 926 so as to measure the porosity of the web 10. The system controller 928 may also measure the properties of the web 10 elsewhere (e.g. at the same locations where controls are performed). </p><p id="p0077" num="0077"> [0057] If the measurement shows that the paper is excessively porous (pressure excessively high), the system controller 928 may, for instance, increase the amount of a fine-grained substance (fine, filler, retention agent), increase pressing between the rolls (nip pressure), increase drying capacity, increase moistening or carry out a combination of the above-mentioned operations. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="22"/>-->
 [0058] If the measurement shows that the paper is too little porous (pressure too low), the system controller 928 may, for instance, decrease the amount of a fine-grained substance (fine, filler, retention agent), decrease pressing between the rolls (nip pressure), decrease drying capacity, decrease moistening or carry out a combination of the above-mentioned operations. </p><p id="p0078" num="0078"> [0059] The system controller 928 may be conceived as a paper machine's control arrangement, or part thereof, based on automatic data processing. The system controller 928 may receive digital signals or convert the received analog signals to digital ones. The system controller 928 may comprise a microprocessor and memory and execute the signal processing and the paper machine control in accordance with appropriate computer programs. The operating principle of the system controller 928 may be, for instance, PID (Proportional-lntegral-Derivative), MPC (Model Predictive Control) or GPC (General Predictive Control) control. </p><p id="p0079" num="0079"> [0060] Figure 10 is a flow chart of the measuring method.
