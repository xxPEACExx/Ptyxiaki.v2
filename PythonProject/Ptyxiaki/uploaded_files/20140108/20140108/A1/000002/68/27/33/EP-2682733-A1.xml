This is due to the fact that all external forces acting on the vehicle, except for the gravitational and aerodynamic forces, are applied through the tires. We could say that "the critical control forces that determine the way in which the vehicle rotates, brakes, and accelerates are developed in the four or more contact areas".</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Mathematical models that represent reality in a simplified manner are used in automobile design. The objective of tire modeling is to find mathematical expressions related to the forces and torques appearing in the tire-road contact with different variables, such as the slip angle, camber angle, slip rate, pressure, travel speed... In order to verify the quality of these formulated mathematical models and verify whether they adjust to reality or not, experimenting with tires becomes necessary.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Tire manufacturers need to compare the forces generated and transmitted by different tire models to determine the best construction for a certain application.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In addition, the design and validation of automobile components require a detailed knowledge of the forces and the moments acting on the tire-road contact, which allows vehicle designers to produce safer and more reliable, efficient, and durable components.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The performance of the control systems of the vehicle can be significantly increased if more detailed information in real time of the forces applied to the tire-road contact could be obtained. On the other hand, the information about the forces and the moments generated at the interface between the tire and the road could be important to understand the causes of accidents.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Currently, there are several methods to measure the forces and the moments<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> generated at the tire-road contact based on the instrumentation of the tire, of the wheel, or of the suspension elements.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The methods based on the instrumentation of the wheel allow measuring the forces and the moments generated at the tire-road contact with greater precision than those based on the instrumentation of the suspension elements, given that the former is closer to the contact area than the latter. In addition, the main application of the systems to measure the forces and the moments generated at the tire-road contact is the assessment of the characteristics of the suspension and its interaction with the chassis of the vehicle. If the forces and the moments are measured with this purpose, the use of measurement methods based on the instrumentation of the suspension elements leads, to a certain extent, to the modification of the elements which characteristics are desired to be assessed. On the other hand, the methods based on the instrumentation of the tire normally require the placement of measurement sensors (accelerometers, optical sensors...) embedded in the interior thereof. They are, therefore, invasive methods in the tire itself that could lead to problems in the assembly of the wheel and produce a greater and irregular wear of the tire. Due to the reasons exposed above, in this invention we propose a method based on the instrumentation of the wheel, and therefore, the review of the state of the art shall be focused on the methods to measure the forces and torques at the tire-road contact wherein the sensors are placed in the wheel.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">There are different dynamometric wheel designs that allow measuring the forces and the moments generated at the tire-road contact. Normally, these wheels are formed by a sensor element that replaces the disc of the original wheel of the vehicle. The sensor element is the component of the dynamometric wheel in charge of measuring the three forces and the three moments generated at the tire-road contact, from the deformation measurements taken by a certain number of strain gauges or piezoelectric sensors placed on the same. The sensor element is a standard component, which may be used in different vehicles regardless of the form of the original wheel of the same. In order to be adapted to the tire size of the vehicle and the screw pattern of the wheel, dynamometric wheels are formed by a "modified rim" and a "hub adapter", between which the standard sensor element is placed. After the modified rim and the hub adapter are connected to the sensor element, the dynamometric wheel can be handled as a normal wheel.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In order to measure the forces and the moments generated at the tire-road contact, the original wheels of the vehicle are replaced with the dynamometric wheels<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> described above, which may have different properties than the original wheels, that is to say, they can have different masses, inertias, stiffness... and therefore, their dynamic behavior can be altered.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Instead, the present invention allows the measurement of forces and the moments appearing in the tire-road contact without the need to change the original wheel of the vehicle. Unlike the dynamometric wheels mentioned above, wherein the strain gauges or piezoelectric sensors are placed in a separate element that replaces the wheel disc, in this invention, the original wheel is the one constituting the element wherein the strain gauges are placed. This way, the invention does not have the disadvantages described above, and therefore, the dynamic behavior of the vehicle remains unaltered.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">For this reason, the instrumented wheel object of patent application <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="US20090125251A1"><text>US 2009/0125251 A1</text></patcit> must be especially mentioned. This wheel allows the measurement of the forces in the hub of the wheel by means of the placement of deformation sensors (such as, for example, strain gauges) in the original wheel of the vehicle. The wheel is instrumented with at least as many strain gauges as forces desired to be determined. The forces are obtained from the deformation components detected by the strain gauges, by applying a characteristic correlation matrix of the instrumented wheel. The appropriate correlation matrix between the forces and the deformation is obtained by means of experimental testing.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">However, the instrumented wheel of the aforementioned patent application only allows the measurement of forces but not moments. On the other hand, given a vector of the loads applied on the wheel, the deformation components take on different values when the angular position of the points wherein the sensors are placed varies with respect to the line of application of the loads, that is to say, when the wheel rotates. For this reason, the correlation matrix relates the vector of the forces to be determined with the vector of the deformation components being measured when the sensors are found in a specific angular position. In fact, in the example included in said patent application, the coefficients of the correlation matrix are obtained in order to obtain the forces from the deformation components being measured when the spoke in which each strain gauge is placed, is found in the tire-road contact area.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The fact that the deformation signals measured on the wheel or on the tire vary according to the angular position of the sensors with respect to the line of application of the loads is one of the inconveniences that may be found when it comes to designing a system to measure the forces and the moments appearing at the tire-road contact.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> Therefore, the deformation signals do not depend only on the forces and the moments desired to be determined and on other factors such as temperature, centrifugal forces, inflation pressure of the tire... but also on the angular position of the measuring points.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Due to the foregoing, in the methods based on the instrumentation of the tire, the following method is frequently applied. In these cases, the deformation signals are only measured when the sensors pass through the same angular position. Based on the deformation signals measured in the specific angular position, the forces and the moments generated at the tire-road contact are determined. The inconvenience of this method is that the frequency with which results of the forces and the moments are obtained is determined by the angular speed of the wheel, which forces the frequency of the sampling to be updated with the change in the angular speed of the same.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Different strategies have been developed to measure the wheel/rail forces in railway vehicles to solve the aforementioned inconvenience, such as, for example, patent <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="US5492002A"><text>US 5492002</text></patcit> or patent application <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="ES2334529A1"><text>ES 2 334 529 A1</text></patcit>.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Both cases propose a measuring method of the forces produced at the wheel/rail contact based on signals that do not depend on the angular position of the sensors with respect to the line of application of the loads. In both methods, the strain gauges are placed in the angular positions that allow, based on the combination of the deformation signals measured by the same, obtaining other signals that are independent from the angular position of the sensors, but do depend on the forces desired to be determined. In the previous patents, for example, pairs of strain gauges are placed at 180° in order to eliminate the even harmonics of the deformation signals and Wheatstone bridges are placed at 90° to eliminate the influence of the angle in the first harmonic of the deformation signal.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">However, these strategies, which are valid for trains, cannot be applied directly to car wheels. The strain gauges can rarely be placed in the angular positions required by the previous strategies. While train wheels are usually continuous flange wheels, spoke wheels are very frequent in the case of cars, or wheels perforated with certain patterns in the case of buses and trucks. There is a broad variety of car wheels, each one of which having a different number of spokes and arrangement thereof, and therefore, each one of which allowing the placement of strain gauges only in certain angular positions. For example, the placement of strain gauges at 180°, as proposed by the previous strategies, would be impossible in a wheel with five spokes spaced at 72°. In addition, the forces and the moments intervening in the wheel/rail contact are not of the same type than those intervening in the tire-road contact.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0019" num="0019">This invention proposes a method that allows obtaining the forces and the moments generated at the tire-road contact by instrumenting the original wheel of the vehicle, due to which its dynamic behavior remains unmodified. These forces and moments are determined by signals that do not depend on the angular position of the sensors. This way, changing the measurement frequency of the forces and the moments with the variation of the angular speed of the wheel is not necessary. These signals are obtained by the combination of the deformation signals measured by the strain gauges placed in the angular positions allowed by the geometry of the wheel. Therefore, it is a flexible method that allows measuring the forces and the moments in wheels with different geometries and number of spokes, given that the strain gauges do not need to be placed in specific angular positions. In addition, the method proposed in this invention allows obtaining, for a certain number of sensors, signals with less ripple than those obtained with the methods developed for train wheels in the aforementioned patents.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>Brief description of the invention</b></heading><p id="p0020" num="0020">The present invention allows the measurement of the three components of the force, F<sub>x</sub>, F<sub>y</sub> and F<sub>z</sub>, and of the three components of moment, M<sub>x</sub>, M<sub>y</sub> and M<sub>z</sub> (<figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 1</figref>), which act on the tire as a consequence of its interaction with the road. These forces and moments are obtained from the combination of the deformation signals ε, measured at different points of the wheel, which shall be referred to as "measuring points" (reference 1 of <figref idrefs="f0002 f0003 f0004">FIG. 3-FIG. 7</figref>). The sensors- such as, for example, strain gauges - are placed at these measuring points to measure the unit deformation in any desired direction (even in the circumferential direction), even though measuring it in the radial direction is recommended, given that in this case, the signals obtained to estimate the forces and the moments at the tire-road contact have less ripple. For example, in the wheels of <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3 and FIG. 4</figref>, the sensors have been placed such that they measure the unit deformation in the radial direction, while in <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 5</figref>, the unit deformation is measured in the circumferential direction.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The measuring points must be grouped in "measuring circumferences" and "measuring radial lines".</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Hereinafter in this document, the set of measuring points found at the same radial distance from the center of the wheel shall be referred to as "measuring circumference" (reference 2 in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>). The set of measuring points of different measuring circumferences generally placed in the same angular position (reference 3 in the image to the right of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>) shall be referred to as "measuring radial line".<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> However, if the geometry of the wheel so requires it, the sensors of the same measuring radial line can be placed in different angular positions (reference 3 in the image to the left of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>).</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Within each measuring circumference, the sensors must be placed in equidistant angular positions, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0002 f0003 f0004">FIG.3-FIG.7</figref>. In said figures, the "measuring radial lines" are shown with reference 3. In some occasions, due to the geometry of the wheel, the placement of the sensors of different measuring circumferences in the same angular position may not be possible. This last case is shown in <figref idrefs="f0004">FIG. 7</figref>, in which in each measuring radial line, the sensors belonging to the two external measuring circumferences are placed at a different angular position than the sensor located in the internal measuring circumference. All of the measuring radial lines used to instrument the wheel must be equal and be separated from one another with identical angular distances, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The present invention constitutes a versatile method, which may be used in wheels constituted by spokes or in continuous flange or perforated wheels, as long as the geometry of the wheel allows the instrumentation thereof with at least five equal measuring radial lines in equidistant angular positions. Therefore, the original wheel of the vehicle can be instrumented directly, without modifying its characteristics and without altering its dynamic behavior. The number of sensors to be used depends on the geometry of the wheel and on the precision desired to be obtained in the measurement of the forces and the moments. Five measuring radial lines and three measuring circumferences must be used as a minimum, which supposes a total of 15 sensors. Regardless of the number of sensors used, the present invention allows obtaining six signals, proportional to the forces and torques desired to be measured, at all times.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In short, the object of the present invention is a method to estimate the forces and torques generated by the contact between the tire and the road. In a first step, the deformation signal of a plurality of measuring points in the wheel mounted by the tire is obtained, by means of a plurality of deformation sensors, such as strain gauges, or piezoelectric sensors.

Hereinafter, the concepts of "symmetry" and "antisymmetry" will play a fundamental role, due to which we shall begin by defining their meaning. In <figref idrefs="f0002">FIG. 3</figref>, the wheel is in a position in which the vertical line passing through the center is a symmetry axis (α = 0). In this position, the radial lines 32 and 33 are symmetrical with respect to lines 35 and 34. When the geometry presents this type of symmetry, the symmetrical forces or torques (M<sub>x</sub>, F<sub>y</sub> and F<sub>z</sub>) produce symmetrical deformations (with the same value), while the antisymmetrical forces or torques (F<sub>x</sub>, M<sub>y</sub> and M<sub>z</sub>) produce antisymmetrical deformations (same absolute value with the opposite sign). For example, when the symmetrical forces or torques M<sub>x</sub>, F<sub>y</sub> and F<sub>z</sub> are applied to the tire-road contact, the strains in the points of radial line 2 are equal to the strains in the same points in radial line 5. In the points of radial line 1, which matches the symmetry axis, the strain can assume a value other than zero. However, when antisymmetrical forces or torques F<sub>x</sub>, M<sub>y</sub> and M<sub>z</sub> are applied to the contact point, the strains at the points of radial line 2 will have the same magnitude and the opposite sign than the corresponding strains in the same points in radial line 5. In the points located in radial line 1, the strain must assume a value equal to zero.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The sine and cosine functions are, respectively, symmetrical and antisymmetrical with respect to the origin of the coordinates, which is why they are the ones used to represent the corresponding symmetrical and antisymmetrical terms of the strains.

In addition, the fact that there are forces<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> or moments generating symmetrical deformation signals and others generating antisymmetrical deformation signals allow them to be decoupled from one another, and therefore, to reduce the number of sensors to be used.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The signals obtained by combining the strain signals measured by the sensors grouped in the same measuring circumference are the following:

This signal is used to obtain a better estimation of the M<sub>y</sub> moment, given that, in the deformation signals generated by this moment, the second harmonic is the dominant harmonic, unlike for remaining forces and torques, in which the dominant harmonic in the deformation signals is the first harmonic.

Even though equations (1) and (3) have been particularized for the case in which all the points of the same measuring radial line are in the same angular position (such as in the image to the right of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>), the signal<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> combinations shown below are equally valid for the case in which all the points of the same measuring radial line are not in the same angular position (such as in the image to the left of <figref idrefs="f0001">FIG. 2</figref>). In this last case, the angle formed between any of the measuring points of the radial line of reference and the line of application of the loads shall be taken as the angular position α.

Reciprocally, the proportionality functions relating the forces or torques F<sub>x</sub>, M<sub>y</sub> and M<sub>z</sub> with the signal <i>E</i><sub>i2</sub> or the signal <i>E</i>'<sub>i2</sub> are pure cosine waves, and the proportionality functions relating the forces or torques of M<sub>x</sub>, F<sub>y</sub> and F<sub>z</sub> with the signal <i>E</i><sub>i2</sub> or the signal <i>E</i>'<sub>i2</sub> are pure sine waves. In the case of the signals <i>E</i><sub>i1</sub> and <i>E</i>i2, these proportionality functions oscillate with a frequency equal to the rotation frequency of the wheel, while in the case of the signals <i>E</i>'<sub>i1</sub> and <i>E</i>'<sub>i2</sub>, the frequency at which the proportionality functions oscillate is equal to double the rotation frequency of the wheel. The sought values of the contact forces and torques are obtained from these proportionality ratios.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">As deduced from equations (8) to (10), this method implies the measurement of the angular position of the radial line of reference of the wheel α.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">The signals E<sub>iS</sub>, E<sub>iA</sub> and E'<sub>iA</sub> (<i>i</i> = 1, 2, ..., <i>n<sub>c</sub></i>) obtained by means of the previous combinations, are practically constant with respect to the variation of the angular position γ<sub>j</sub> and do not depend on ζ<sub>i</sub>. The signal E<sub>iS</sub> is a signal proportional to the forces or torques M<sub>x</sub>, F<sub>y</sub> and F<sub>z</sub>, while the signals E<sub>iA</sub> and E'<sub>iA</sub> (<i>i</i> = 1, 2, ..., <i>n<sub>c</sub></i>) are proportional to the forces or torques F<sub>x</sub>, M<sub>y</sub> and M<sub>z</sub>. In these signals, the proportionality constants do not depend on the angular position of the sensors γ<sub>j</sub>. The reason why these signals do not depend on ζ<sub>i</sub> is because, by making the previous signal combinations, the continuous component of the deformation signals is eliminated. The fact that the combined signals do not depend on the angular position in a significant manner allows the forces and the moments in the tire-road contact to be measured at any moment in time, regardless of the angular position of the sensors with respect to the line of application of the loads.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">Therefore, signals E<sub>iS</sub>, E<sub>iA</sub> and E'<sub>iA</sub> (<i>i</i> = 1, 2, ..., n<sub>c</sub>) that only depend on the forces and the moments desired to be determined are obtained based on the deformation signals and on the angular position of a radial line of reference.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">This way, the deformation signals obtained at the points grouped in measuring circumferences and measuring radial lines must be processed to obtain at least six signals proportional to the six forces and torques desired to be determined. Even though carrying out this processing at a control unit located inside of the vehicle is possible, we recommend carrying out said processing in a microcontroller located in the wheel, due to the high amount of deformation signals to be transmitted to the control unit of the vehicle in the opposite case (n<sub>c</sub> x n<sub>r</sub> + 1 signals). Therefore, we recommend introducing said signals into a microcontroller by means of the corresponding Analog/Digital converter, which must have at least n<sub>c</sub> x n<sub>r</sub> + 1 channels to process the deformation<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> signals according to the equations (4)-(10). The deformation signals can be obtained by means of an appropriate sensor, such as strain gauges, piezoelectric sensors... these sensors must admit at least 10,000 µε in the positive and negative. The deformation signals are very low level, due to which they need to be amplified.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">We recommend the use of linear strain gauges placed in the radial direction. Due to the fact that the unit deformation or strain is desired to be measured, and the temperature compensation is carried out thanks to the signal combination carried out in the microprocessor, each one of the strain gauges can be adapted to a ¼ of a Wheatstone bridge.

Due to the geometrical shape of the wheel of <figref idrefs="f0003">FIG. 6</figref>, eight strain gauges can be placed in equidistant angular positions at 45° in each measuring circumference. For this reason, this wheel has been instrumented with eight measuring<!-- EPO <DP n="27"> --> radial lines, as shown in said figure. Therefore, this wheel has 24 strain gauges in total.</p><p id="p0085" num="0085">The signals coming from these strain gauges, which still depend on the rotation of the wheel, must be combined with each other by applying equations (17), (18), (8), (9) and (10) to eliminate this dependency. This way, the signals E<sub>1S</sub>, E<sub>2S</sub> and E<sub>3S</sub> of equation system (32) are obtained by applying the equations (17) and (8) to the sensors placed at radial distances of 20.6 cm, 10.7 cm and 24.9 cm, respectively. The signals E<sub>2A</sub> and E<sub>3A</sub> of equation system (33) are obtained by combining the signals of the sensors placed at the radial distances of 10.7 cm and 24.9 cm, respectively, according to equations (17) and (9). The signal <i>E'</i><sub>1A</sub> appearing in equation system (33) is obtained by combining the signals of the sensors placed at a radial distance of 10.7 cm according to equations (18) and (10).</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">This combination can be carried out in a microcontroller located in the wheel itself. Likewise, the signals coming from the strain bridges can be sent via telemetry to the control unit located in the vehicle. Measuring the angular position α of a radial line of reference with respect to the line of application of the loads is necessary to carry out the combination of signals, due to which an appropriate sensor, such as an encoder or a resolver, must be used. After carrying out this combination of signals, E<sub>iS</sub> only depends on the forces or moments generating symmetrical deformation signals, while E<sub>iA</sub> and <i>E'</i><sub>1A</sub> only depend on the forces or moments generating antisymmetrical deformation signals (<figref idrefs="f0007">FIG. 14</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0008">FIG. 16</figref>).</p><p id="p0087" num="0087">Therefore, the forces and moments can be measured in a continuous manner, independently from the angular position of the wheel, by solving equation systems (32) and (33).</p></description><claims mxw-id="PCLM56982186" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office"><!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --><claim id="c-en-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>Method for estimating the forces and torques generated by the contact of the tire with the road that comprises the following steps:
