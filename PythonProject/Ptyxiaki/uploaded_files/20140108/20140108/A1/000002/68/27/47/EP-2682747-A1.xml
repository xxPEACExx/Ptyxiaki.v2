More specifically, the present invention relates to a device for spermatozoa selection having a first chamber that is adapted to receive a first, seminal fluid and a second chamber that is adapted to receive a second fluid, the first chamber and the second chamber being fluidly connected by at least one duct. The devices and methods of the present invention can be used to increase the quality of semen samples, and in particular to select and concentrate spermatozoa for motility and/or maturity.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Poor-quality semen samples correlate with failed fertilization, impaired preimplantation development and pregnancy outcome. Factors that negatively contribute to sperm sample quality include meiotic alterations, aneuploidy or sperm DNA damage, particularly sperm DNA fragmentation.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Devices for removing spermatozoa from seminal fluid having a first container and a second container in which a capillary tube provides a liquid bridge between the containers were disclosed by the present inventor in <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO9417742A1"><text>WO-A1 94/17742</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO03031564A2"><text>WO-A2 03/031564</text></patcit>, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The selection device disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="WO03031564A2"><text>WO-A2 03/031564</text></patcit> is illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0001">Figures 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0002">2</figref>. As shown, the selection device comprises a first bridge element 3 having four channels 6a-6d and a chamber element 27 having a first ring-shaped chamber 1 for receiving seminal fluid 13 and a second chamber 2 for receiving a medium 12a, the second chamber 12a being connected to the first ring-shaped chamber 1 over a ring-shaped connection 5. The bridge element 3 comprises four boundary walls 4a-4e forming the channels 6a-6d, an additional channel 7 being formed by the boundary wall 4e with the boundary wall of the ring-shaped connection 5 when the bridge element is fitted on the chamber element 27.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">As specified in <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="WO03031564A2"><text>WO-A2 03/031564</text></patcit>, selection is performed by filling seminal fluid 13 with spermatozoa into the first ring-shaped chamber 1 such that said seminal fluid does not reach openings 8a-8d and 9 of the channels on the side of the ring-shaped chamber 1 and fitting the bridge element 3 onto the chambers 1, 2. Subsequently, the medium 12a is filled into the chamber 2 over the central opening 29 such that the channels 6a-6d and 7 are filled with medium 12a. Also the seminal fluid 13 in the first ring-shaped chamber 1 may be covered with medium until reaching openings 8a-8d and 9 of the channels on the side of the ring-shaped chamber 1. The channels 6a-6d and 7, therefore, may provide a liquid bridge that is free of currents, allowing the spermatozoa to move through the liquid bridges formed by channels 6a-6d and 7 into the medium in the central chamber 2.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">As discovered by the present inventor, the quality of spermatozoa collected in the central chamber 2 of the selection device described above, including spermatozoa yield, is highly dependant upon the volume of seminal fluid filled into the first ring-shaped chamber 1. In particular, the prior selection device is optimized for specific amounts of seminal fluid and smaller volumes have to be compensated by using additional medium. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that the increasing volume of medium required in the first ring-shaped chamber will lead to a lower density of spermatozoa in the central chamber. In this context, it has been discovered that the efficiency of prior art selection devices may be reduced in particular when using seminal fluid volumes of 1 ml or less. Notably, many male patients requiring spermatozoa selection, e.g. for in-vitro fertilization procedures, provide semen samples of 2 ml or less. Also, prior art devices might not function ideally if too much or too little medium is used.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Furthermore, the prior art device disclosed in <patcit id="pcit0005" dnum="WO03031564A2"><text>WO-A2 03/031564</text></patcit> might require spreading the seminal fluid across the surface of the first ring-shaped chamber 1. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that spermatozoa may be mechanically and/or chemically damaged (e.g., due to contact with atmospheric O<sub>2</sub>) during this procedure, in particular, when attempting to spread small volumes of seminal fluid evenly across the surface of said first ring-shaped chamber 1. It is further believed that higher dilution of the sperm sample may increase the time required for the selection procedure. This might affect spermatozoa quality (e.g., due to chemical damage) and could allow spermatozoa of lower quality to reach the central chamber 2.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0008" num="0008">As surprisingly discovered by the present inventor and disclosed in commonly assigned, copending <patcit id="pcit0006" dnum="WO2012032165A"><text>WO 2012/032165</text></patcit>, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, the quality of seminal fluids may be improved substantially by placing a seminal fluid in the first chamber of the above selection device, filing a second chamber of a selection device with a medium for receiving DNA strand break-free spermatozoa and connecting both chambers by a bridge element such that a fluid bridge is formed between the first chamber and the second chamber, which allows the DNA strand break-free spermatozoa to move from said first chamber to said second chamber. However, it has been noted that spermatozoa with strand breaks may be drawn from the first chamber through the fluid bridge when collecting the DNA strand break-free spermatozoa from the second chamber. Without being bound by theory, it is assumed that a slight macroscopic current from the first chamber through the liquid bridge into the second chamber may be caused when the sample is collected.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In view of the above, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved selection device and a corresponding method that overcomes some or all drawbacks of the prior art. In particular, it is an object of the present invention to provide a selection device and method that can be used with small amounts of seminal fluid.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">A further object of the present invention is to provide an improved selection device and method that does not require dilution of the seminal fluid for selection procedures or reduces the amount of dilution required.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">A further object of the present invention is to provide an improved selection device and method where the same amount of medium may be used irrespectively of the volume of seminal fluid available.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">A further object of the present invention is to provide an improved selection device and method wherein the exposure of the seminal fluid to oxygen before, during and/or after the selection procedure is reduced.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">A further object of the present invention is to provide a selection device and method wherein wetting of the fluid connection is improved.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Furthermore, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved selection device and method that prevents contamination of the collected sample by spermatozoa with strand breaks.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">A further object of the present invention is to reduce the time required for the selection procedure.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The above-mentioned objectives are achieved by the improved selection device according to the claims. Further aspects, improvements and variations are disclosed in the Figures and the description.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In the context of the present disclosure, the terms "upper" and "lower" denominate those parts of the device located closer to the upper end and the lower end of the device, respectively, when the assembled device is held in an upright manner such that the first and second fluids can be received in the chambers.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">According to an embodiment of the invention, the device for spermatozoa selection comprises a first chamber configured to receive a first, seminal fluid; a second chamber configured to receive a second fluid, the second chamber being in fluid communication with the first chamber by means of at least one duct having a first opening to the first chamber and a second opening to the second chamber; and a displacement means adapted to displace at least some of the first, seminal fluid towards or to the first opening. In preferred embodiments, the displacement means is adapted to displace the first, seminal fluid such that the upper surface, i.e., the filling level, of the first, seminal fluid is arranged at a predetermined distance from the first opening.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">As the filling level of the first, seminal fluid in the first chamber may be adjusted with the displacement means, the device of the present disclosure can be used with different volumes of first, seminal fluid. The displacement means allows adapting the volume and/or the shape of the first chamber such that it may be used with seminal fluid volumes as small as 1 ml or less, preferably 0.5 ml or less. Semen samples of small volume, therefore, require less or no dilution.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In the context of the present invention, the term fluid may relate to any fluid that allows self-propelled movement of motile cells, in particular liquids or gels. Thus, each of the first and second fluids may also be denominated as liquid or gel.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The first, seminal fluid preferably is a seminal fluid which might be of poor quality, such as a seminal fluid comprising a substantial amount of spermatozoa with decreased motility and/or maturity, particularly spermatozoa with meiotic alterations, aneuploidy or sperm DNA damage, particularly sperm DNA fragmentation, e.g. DNA strand breaks. For example, the first fluid may comprise at least 15 % oligo-, at least 32 % astheno-, and/or at least 4 % teratozoospermia based on the total amount of spermatozoa in the fluid. In embodiments, the first, seminal fluid may be a semen sample (i.e. ejaculate) of a patient. However, the first fluid may also be a fluid with other motile cells, which may also be selected by the device of the present invention. Most preferably, the first, seminal fluid comprises a substantial amount of spermatozoa with DNA strand breaks.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The second fluid preferably is a medium for receiving spermatozoa or other motile cells, e.g., a buffer medium. Selected cells are preferably received in the second fluid contained in the second chamber during the selection process. The second fluid may then be extracted, e.g. by means of a pipette, and used in or further processed for artificial reproductive technologies (e.g., artificial insemination), cryopreservation or diagnostic purposes. Alternatively, one or several ova may be located in the second chamber. Such configuration may be used, for example, to simulate more closely a natural and physiological selection of sperm during in-vitro fertilization.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">When the duct is filled with a liquid, the duct preferably provides a liquid bridge between the first chamber and the second chamber. Preferably, spermatozoa in the first chamber can move along this liquid bridge to the second chamber when the fluids in the first and second chambers reach the first and second openings of the duct, respectively.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">According to the present invention, the first chamber may be provided by a vessel with a closed lower end, preferably a tubular vessel, such that the first, seminal fluid gathers at said closed lower end under the effect of gravity. The closed lower end may be of any suitable shape, for example conical, truncated, rounded (e.g., hemispherical) or flat.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Further, the lower end of the vessel may be shaped to be self-standing. For example, the lower end may be provided with a stand, which may be formed by a cylindrical protrusion projecting over the closed lower end.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The vessel may further be provided with an open upper end, through which the first, seminal fluid may be brought into the first chamber, e.g., by introducing it with a pipette. The vessel may be formed of any suitable material, for example, plastics or glass. Translucent or transparent materials are preferred.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">According to the present invention, the displacement means may comprise a displacement element (which may also be denominated as a displacement body) and/or a shaft for manipulating the displacement means. The displacement element preferably is located at the lower end of the displacement means. The shaft preferably is hollow and opens out into the second chamber. The shaft and the second chamber may be fluidly connected such that the second fluid can be filled into the second chamber through the shaft and/or such that the second fluid can be collected by extending a pipette through said shaft into the second chamber, for example, once the separated spermatozoa are contained therein. The displacement element and the shaft may be integrally formed or connected in a fixed or detachable manner. Any suitable material, for example, plastics or glass, may be used to form the displacement body and/or the shaft. Again, translucent or transparent materials are preferred.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The displacement means preferably is received within the first chamber and/or the vessel in a slidable manner, thereby ensuring safe and easy manipulation of the device. More preferably, the displacement means is concentrically received in the vessel and slidable along the vessel's longitudinal axis. Spacers and/or guides may be used to properly define the position of the displacement means and guide the displacement means within the vessel. Alternatively or additionally, the vessel and the displacement means (and/or further components connected therewith) may be provided with interacting threaded portions in order to guide the displacement means into the vessel and/or in order to maintain the displacement means at a certain position relative to the vessel during the selection procedure.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The second chamber may be located in the vessel when the device is assembled. As such, the second chamber forms in use a "central" or "inner" chamber, while the first chamber forms in use a "surrounding" or "outer" chamber. In other embodiments, an outer receptacle may form the second chamber and receive a vessel forming the first chamber therein.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The second chamber may have a volume of 0.5 ml or less. In embodiments, part of this volume may be provided by the hollow shaft.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0031" num="0031">At least a part of the displacement element may have a hemispherical, substantially hemispherical, conical, substantially conical, cylindrical, or substantially cylindrical outer surface. The outer surface of the displacement means may or may not match the inner surface of the first chamber. The lower portion of the displacement means and/or the displacement element may have an outer shape that generally corresponds to the inner shape of the closed lower end of the vessel. A variable gap may be formed between the displacement means and the vessel. The gap may be formed such that it increases (e.g., in width) from a lower part of the first chamber towards an upper part of the first chamber when the displacement means is inserted as far as possible into the vessel ("fully inserted position"). For example, the outer surface of the displacement element may follow the inner surface of the first chamber along inferior sections thereof, and separate from the first chamber along upper sections, such that at least a substantial portion, preferably substantially all or most of the first, seminal fluid in the first chamber is gathered in the upper section proximate the first opening in a collection space formed between the first chamber and the displacement means.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In preferred embodiments of the invention, the second chamber may be comprised in the displacement means. The second chamber may be integrally formed with the displacement means, in particular the displacement element, or connected therewith in a fixed manner. For example, the displacement element may be provided with an opening or hollow surrounded by an upwardly extending rim that forms the second chamber. This allows configuring the device in a space-saving and user-friendly manner.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The displacement means can further comprise a ring-shaped cover. The ring-shaped cover may extend along or around the periphery of the rim at a defined distance, thereby forming the duct between the rim and the ring-shaped cover. The ring-shaped cover preferably is located at least 0.1 mm, preferably at least 0.2 mm, and more preferably between 0.3 mm and 0.4 mm from the rim for this purpose. Accordingly, the duct preferably has a width of at least 0.1 mm, more preferably at least 0.2 mm and most preferably between 0.3 mm and 0.4 mm. The stated distances and/or widths allow optimal filling and wetting of the duct by capillary action exerted on the first, seminal fluid and/or the second fluid. This ensures that the duct forms the liquid bridge between the first chamber and the second chamber. The ring-shaped cover may be formed integrally with or connected to the shaft in a fixed or detachable manner. The ring-shaped cover may be formed from any suitable material, for example plastics or glass. Further,<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> the ring-shaped cover (in addition to or instead of the spacers/guides mentioned above) may help defining the position of the displacement means in the vessel, for example by maintaining the displacement means in a concentric position.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">According to other embodiments, the duct may have a maximal width of 1 mm, preferably 0.5 mm along its entire length or at least a segment.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The length of the duct preferably is between 2 to 40 mm, more preferably between 5 to 35 mm, most preferably between 5 to 15 mm as measured from the first opening to the second opening, for example when considering a cross section of the device along its longitudinal axis. This ensures filling of the channel by capillary action and optimal enrichment of DNA strand break-free spermatozoa in the second chamber, whereas longer ducts may lead to an undesirable selection of spermatozoa according to sex characteristics..</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The duct preferably comprises at least a first segment that extends in a direction having a directional component towards the upper end of the device and at least a second segment that extends in a direction having a directional component towards the lower end of the device. When following the duct from its first opening to its second opening, the first, upwardly extending segment preferably is prior to the second, downwardly extending segment. Preferably, the course of the duct described above can be appreciated when considering a cross section along the longitudinal axis of the device.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">According to the present invention, the duct may have a U-, V-, or W-shaped cross section, for example, when considering a cross section along a longitudinal axis of the device and/or a longitudinal axis of the displacement means. This means that the duct may have the shape of a U, a V, or a W when a cross section of the device and/or the displacement means along the respective longitudinal axis is considered. In embodiments, the duct may be substantially U-, V-, or W-shaped.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The duct preferably extends along a part, most or the entire perimeter of the second chamber. The selection device may comprise several such ducts extending along the perimeter of the second chamber according to embodiments of the invention.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The cross section preferably has the shape of an inverted U, a first leg of the U extending into the first chamber and a second leg of the U extending into the second chamber. The duct may,<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> thus, provide a fluid communication between said first chamber and said second chamber that requires motile cells (e.g., spermatozoa) located in the first chamber to "swim" or move against gravity along at least a segment of the duct in order to arrive at the second chamber. Preferably, the second leg of the U is longer than the first leg, i.e., the second leg extends further into the second chamber than the first leg extends into the first chamber. In other embodiments the first leg may be longer than the second.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">According to the present invention, the device may be provided with a scale for assessing a volume of the first, seminal fluid in the first chamber (first scale). Said first scale may be provided, for example, on the vessel forming the first chamber, e.g., on an inner or an outer surface thereof. Additionally or alternatively the volume introduced into the first chamber may also be assessed by other means, for example a pipette.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">A scale for assessing travel of the displacement means may also be provided (second scale). The second scale may be used for assessing how far the displacement means and/or the displacement element has been introduced into the first chamber. The scale may be provided, for example, on the displacement means or the vessel forming the first chamber, whereas the other of the displacement means and the vessel may be provided with a reference line or indentation for measuring travel on the second scale. Marks, lines, indentations and/or similar means may form the gradations of the first and/or second scales. The gradations may be spaced apart in a regular or irregular manner.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">According to embodiments of the invention, the second scale may indicate the travel required for the displacement means dependant upon the volume of first, seminal fluid provided in the first chamber. This means, the second scale may indicate the optimal position of the displacement means and/or the displacement element dependant upon said volume of first, seminal fluid. The gradations of the second scale may indicate how far the displacement means should be introduced into the first chamber or vessel in order to displace a predetermined volume of the first, seminal fluid towards the first opening._Preferably, the second scale indicates how far the displacement means should be introduced into the first chamber or vessel in order to displace the first, seminal fluid such that a fixed gap remains between the first, seminal fluid and the first opening, regardless of the volume of first, seminal fluid provided in the first chamber.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The extent to which the fluid level in the first chamber raises when the displacement means is inserted depends on several factors, including the shape of the first chamber and the shape of the displacement means. It may not be linearly related to the travel of the displacement means. While a large travel may be required for small volumes, the difference in travel may be minimal for larger volumes. The second scale may account for these effects. For example, the second scale may be non-linear and the distance between adjacent gradations may diminish with increasing volume. The second scale may be used to insert the displacement means to the required travel after determining the volume of first, seminal fluid in the first chamber with the first scale and/or other means (e.g., a pipette).</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">In mechanical or electromechanical implementations of the invention, the travel of the displacement means may be measured with sensors and/or controlled by actors.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">In embodiments, the present invention may also include a closure means for sealing the first chamber relative to the environment, e.g., by covering and/or sealing the open upper end of the vessel. The closure means may be a plug, for example, a plug with a through hole that can be connected to the shaft. The closure means may be formed of any material suitable for sealing the first chamber in an airtight or substantially airtight manner (e.g., rubber). When the first chamber is sealed relative to the environment, the fluid in the first chamber will not be drawn into the second chamber even when collecting the fluid contained therein, for example, with a pipette. Therefore, the plug avoids that spermatozoa with strand breaks are drawn into the second chamber when DNA strand break-free spermatozoa contained therein are collected.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">According to embodiments of the invention, the closure means (e.g., the plug) may be inserted into the first chamber after sealing it therewith. More specifically, the closure means may be inserted into the vessel after sealing it, for example, at its open upper end. While any suitable type of closure means may be employed for this purpose, the closure means preferably are configured such that they can be inserted a predetermined and/or fixed depth into the vessel. For example, the plug may comprise an abutment surface that inhibits insertion of the plug when the predetermined depth is reached.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">In embodiments, a cap (e.g., a screw cap that can be screwed onto the vessel) may be used for pressing the plug against the vessel in order to provide an airtight seal. Further, the cap may also be used for inserting the plug (with or without an abutment surface) to the predetermined<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> depth. The cap may have an attachment structure (e.g., a threaded portion with an internal or external thread or a snap fit) that engages or is engaged by an attachment means (e.g., an external or internal thread or a snap fit) provided on the vessel. The plug may be separate from the cap, attached thereto or formed integrally therewith. Insertion of the closure means into the vessel may lead to a positive pressure in the first chamber, which may cause some of the fluid in the duct (e.g., fluid in the inner part of the duct proximate the second opening) to flow into the second chamber. This may increase spermatozoa yield obtained by the selection procedure. According to the present invention, the device may further comprise a pipette containing a predetermined volume of the second fluid. This ensures that the correct volume of the second fluid is used and that the duct is wetted in an optimal manner. Since the level of the first, seminal fluid in the first chamber may be adapted with the displacement means, the volume of second fluid in the pipette may be fixed and may be independent of the volume to be provided in the first chamber. This may ensure that a correct volume of second fluid is provided in the second chamber and reproducible results are obtained. The pipette may be configured and adapted for injecting the second fluid into the second chamber of the device and/or extracting fluids from said second chamber. Optionally, the pipette may be configured such that the fluid is not injected into the second chamber too quickly. This may be useful for preventing formation of air bubbles in the second fluid, which might occlude part of the duct. Also, the pipette may be configured such that the fluid is not injected into the second chamber too slowly. This may be useful for ensuring that the duct is filled adequately. In embodiments, the volume of second fluid provided in the pipette may be 0.5 ml or less, corresponding to the amount which ideally is injected into the uterus.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">The selecting device of the present invention may be reusable or disposable, i.e., intended for single use. Disposable use may be preferred in accordance with regulatory provisions.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">The present invention may also relate to a kit comprising a device for selecting spermatozoa and a pipette containing a predetermined volume of the second fluid.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">Further, the present invention may relate to a method for selection of motile cells (e.g. spermatozoa) by using the device described above. The method may include the steps of (a) providing a first fluid comprising motile cells in the first chamber of the device; (b) providing a buffer medium in the second chamber of the device; (c) connecting the first chamber and the second chamber by means of a liquid connection; and (d) displacing at least<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> some of the first fluid towards, proximate the first opening of the duct with the displacement means.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">As discovered by the inventor, this method may be used to select spermatozoa for motility and/or maturity, and in particular to obtain a fluid in the second chamber enriched with DNA strand break free spermatozoa.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">According to a further embodiment of the invention, the seminal plasma remaining after spermatozoa selection may be used in other procedures, for example, seminal plasma infusion.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">According to a further aspect, the present invention relates to a funnel structure for filling a liquid into a vessel. The funnel structure preferably has an inlet opening having a first cross-sectional area and an outlet opening having a second cross-sectional area, the first cross-sectional area being larger than the second cross-sectional area. The inlet opening preferably is positioned such that it is above the outlet opening when the funnel is in an upright position. Further, the funnel structure preferably comprises an intermediate opening. When the funnel structure is in an upright position, said intermediate opening preferably is disposed between the inlet opening and the outlet opening.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">The funnel structure preferably is configured for being attached to a vessel and may comprise an attachment structure. Suitable attachment structures may include, inter alia, a portion of the funnel structure providing a form fit and/or a friction fit with the vessel. For example, the funnel structure may be provided with a portion having an internal thread, an external thread, a snap fit and/or a screw on collar. The attachment structure preferably is configured to provide a leak-proof attachment with the vessel, such that a liquid contained in the vessel cannot leak in the area of the attachment, for example, when the vessel and the funnel structure are laid horizontally or turned upside-down. Preferably, the funnel structure is provided with a cylindrical portion (e.g., a cylindrical portion with an internal thread) that surrounds an opening of the vessel and, therefore, also prevents the vessel's inner walls from being contacted by foreign elements. Thus, the likelihood of contamination is minimized.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">The funnel structure preferably has a recuperation compartment or chamber that is configured to collect and retain at least part of the liquid contained in the vessel when the vessel and/or funnel is laid horizontally or turned upside-down, for example, when it is knocked over<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> inadvertently. The recuperation compartment preferably is further configured such that the liquid collected and retained therein flows back into the vessel when the vessel is positioned in an upright position thereafter. The recuperation compartment may have an upper closed end and be open in a downward direction. The opening of the recuperation compartment may be provided around the intermediate opening.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">The funnel structure preferably comprises a first circumferential wall that tapers inwardly when following the longitudinal axis of the funnel structure in a direction from the inlet opening to the outlet opening. The first circumferential wall preferably has a generally conical shape along at least a segment thereof. The first circumferential wall may form a first funnel, which may be an outer funnel according to aspects of the invention. The first circumferential wall may extend to and/or form the outlet opening. Furthermore, the first circumferential wall may extend proximate the inlet opening.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">The funnel structure preferably also comprises a second circumferential wall. The second circumferential wall may taper inwardly when following the longitudinal axis of the funnel structure in a direction from the inlet opening to the outlet opening and may have a generally conical shape along at least a segment thereof. The second circumferential wall may extend generally parallel to the first circumferential wall along at least a segment. Further, the second circumferential wall may form a second funnel, which may be an inner funnel that is disposed within the outer funnel entirely or along a segment. The first circumferential wall may extend to and/or form the inlet opening. Furthermore, the first circumferential wall may extend to and/or form the intermediate opening.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">The recuperation compartment may be provided between the first and second circumferential walls. The first and second circumferential walls preferably are connected by an upper wall, which may form the upper closed end of the recuperation chamber according to aspects of the disclosure. While the term "circumferential" is used, it should be noted that neither the funnel structure nor the first and second circumferential walls have to be rotationally symmetric. In embodiments, one or both of these walls may or may not surround the funnel structure entirely.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">The first and second circumferential walls of the funnel may be formed integrally, for example, from a single material (e.g., a polymeric material or glass).<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><p id="p0060" num="0060">The funnel structure may comprise an air vent. The air vent preferably provides an additional fluid connection between the interior of the vessel to which the funnel structure is attached and the environment. Thus, formation of air bubbles may be prevented when the funnel structure is filled. The air vent preferably provides a fluid connection between the interior of the vessel and the recuperation compartment. In this case, any liquid flowing out of the vessel through the air vent may be collected in said recuperation compartment. The air vent may be provided by a hole traversing the first circumferential wall.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">The funnel structure may be reusable but, preferably, is a disposable article configured for single use. The funnel structure may be particularly advantageous for laboratory applications.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">The funnel structure provides an improved type of funnel that prevents liquids, for example valuable liquids, from being spilled when the vessel into which the liquids are filled is knocked over or turned around.

The attachment means may be provided proximate the open upper end of the vessel. A kit comprising the funnel structure and a selection device may be provided according to aspects of the present invention. It should be noted, however, that the funnel structure may also be provided separately.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">According to a further aspect, a stand for a vessel is provided. The stand may be used for holding the device of the present invention in an upright position, e.g., when the funnel structure is attached to the device and/or when the selection procedure is performed.

Male patients that have to provide such samples are often nervous and, sometimes, knock over the vessel in which the sample is received. The funnel structure prevents loss of all or most of the sample in this case. It is also particularly useful in this context that the funnel structure may prevent contamination of the inside of the vessel. For example, the funnel structure may prevent the patient from contacting the inner surfaces of the vessel with the hands or the penis, thereby reducing the likelihood of contamination.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">Moreover, when the funnel structure is used with the vessel of the selection device, the sperm sample may be received in the vessel used for spermatozoa selection directly. Transfers from one vessel to another, which might lead to mechanical and/or chemical damage of the sperm cells and loss of the sperm cells remaining in the used vessels, are thus avoided.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">The Figures described below disclose embodiments of the invention for illustrational purposes only.

However, displacing the first, seminal fluid 135 to contact the first opening 112 may be<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> considered for some applications. With the selection device of the present invention, the space S between the first, seminal fluid 135 and the first opening 112 may be equalized for a broad range of volumes of first, seminal fluid provided in the first chamber 135 by inserting the displacement element 109 to the appropriate depth L. Since, the volume of second fluid 136 can be kept constant and reproducible results can be obtained.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 7C</figref>, the second fluid, for example, a buffer medium is subsequently provided in the second chamber 115. As mentioned above, the second fluid preferably is drawn into the duct 111 by capillary action and/or due to the pressure exerted when filling it into the second chamber, for example, along the shaft 123 by means of a pipette. Accordingly, the duct 111 establishes a liquid bridge between the first chamber 103 and the second chamber 115, allowing spennatozoa to move along the path indicated by the arrows shown on <figref idrefs="f0005">Figures 6</figref> and <figref idrefs="f0006">7C</figref>. As schematically illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0006">Figure 7D</figref>, spermatozoa or other motile cells in the first fluid 135 will swim or flow from the first chamber through the duct 119 into second fluid 136 contained in the second chamber.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">Once spermatozoa are separated (e.g., after waiting for 15-120 min.) the second fluid may be withdrawn from the second chamber, for example, by means of a pipette introduced through the shaft 123. The first chamber 103 may be sealed relative to the environment (e.g. by closing the open upper end of the vessel 104 with the plug 127, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0003">Figure 3A</figref>) in order to prevent first, seminal fluid 135 from being drawn into the second chamber 115 when collecting the fluid contained therein.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the sequence of the steps described above may be changed in embodiments of the invention. For example, the second fluid 136 may be received in the second chamber 115 before the displacement means is introduced into the first chamber 103. Furthermore, the displacement means may be introduced into the first chamber before the first, seminal fluid 135 is received therein.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">The ring-shaped cover 119 preferably is located at least 0.1 mm, preferably at least 0.2 mm, and more preferably between 0.3 and 0.4 mm from the rim. Accordingly, the duct 111 preferably has a width of at least 0.1 mm, more preferably at least 0.2 mm and most preferably between 0.3 and 0.4 mm. As will be understood by the skilled person, the optimal widths will<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> depend on the materials and the fluids employed, as both may influence capillary action. The length of the duct 111 preferably is between 15 to 40 mm, more preferably between 20 to 38 mm, most preferably between 25 to 35 mm as measured from the first opening to the second opening when considering a cross section of the displacement element along longitudinal axis B.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">The outer surface of the lower portion of the displacement means that is introduced into the first chamber, in particular the outer surface of the displacement element 109, may be shaped in different ways, for example in a substantially spherical, hemispherical, conical, truncated or cylindrical manner. Also the inner surface of the first chamber 103, in particular the inner surface of the closed lower end of the vessel 104 may have various shapes. As such, the inner surface may be, inter alia, substantially hemispherical, conical, truncated or cylindrical. Depending on the particular requirements, the above-mentioned shapes may be combined as desired. For example, rounded displacement means may be used with conical vessels and vice-versa.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083"><figref idrefs="f0007 f0008">Figures 8A-8E</figref> illustrate different embodiments of displacement means for devices according to the present invention, the forms of which may also be combined. As shown in these Figures, a gap G may be formed between the lower portion of the displacement means 105 and the interior wall of the vessel 104. More specifically, the gap G preferably is formed between the displacement element 109 and the vessel 104.</p><p id="p0084" num="0084">As shown in <figref idrefs="f0007">Figures 8A-8C</figref>, the gap G may be variable. In this case, the gap G preferably is formed such that a relatively large fraction of the first, seminal fluid received in the first chamber is displaced from the bottom of the first chamber proximate the first opening of the duct. The gap G may provide an enlarged collection space proximate the first opening. For this purpose, the width of the gap G preferably increases from a lower part towards an upper part of the first chamber 103 when the displacement means 105 is fully inserted. For example, the displacement element 109 may follow the inner surface of the first chamber at the bottom of the vessel 104 (i.e. at the closed lower end) and separate from the first chamber proximate the first opening 112 in order to form the collection space (see, for example, <figref idrefs="f0007">Figure 8A</figref>).<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --></p><p id="p0085" num="0085">However, as shown in <figref idrefs="f0008">Figures 8D and 8E</figref>, the shape of the displacement element 109 may also match the shape of the lower end of the vessel 104. For example, both elements may have a generally hemispherical (<figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 8D</figref>) or generally conical (<figref idrefs="f0008">Figure 8E</figref>) shape along at least their contacting segments. As further apparent from <figref idrefs="f0007 f0008">Figures 8A-8E</figref>, the displacement means 109 may have different sizes and displacement volumes, the displacement means 109 of <figref idrefs="f0008">Figures 8D and 8E</figref> being somewhat "shorter" along the longitudinal axis B. It should be noted that any of displacement means described above (e.g., the displacement means illustrated in <figref idrefs="f0007 f0008">Figures 8A-8E</figref>) may be "shortened" or "elongated" in order to provide the displacement element 109 with a desired displacement volume and/or shape.</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">As further shown in <figref idrefs="f0009">Figures 9 and 10</figref>, the device may be provided with first and second scales 129, 131 for assessing the volume of the first, seminal fluid provided in the first chamber and the travel of the displacement means relative to the vessel 104, respectively. In the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="f0009">Figures 9 and 10</figref>, the first scale 129 is provided on the vessel 104 and the second scale 131 is provided on the displacement means 105 (e.g., at an upper portion). However, the second scale may also be located on the vessel 104, for example, at an upper portion thereof. While the second scale 131 is described above as being located at the upper portion of the vessel 104 and the displacement means 105, it should be noted that the second scale may be located at any suitable height along the longitudinal axis of the device.</p><p id="p0087" num="0087">In embodiments of the invention, the second scale 131 may indicate the travel required for the displacement means dependant upon the volume of first, seminal fluid provided in the first chamber.

The pipette 140 may be adapted for being inserted into the shaft 123 and may contain a defined and/or fixed volume of second fluid 136, determined such that optimal wetting of the duct is ensured. Since the fluid level in the first chamber may be adjusted with the displacement means, this volume may be fixed, regardless of the volume of first, seminal fluid provided in the first chamber. Further, the pipette 140 may be configured to inject the second fluid 136 at a predetermined speed and/or with a predetermined pressure in order to prevent formation of air bubbles in the second fluid 136. The device 101 and the pipette 140 may be provided as a kit.</p><p id="p0090" num="0090">According to embodiments of the invention, the closure means (e.g., plug 127) may be inserted into the first chamber 103 after sealing it therewith.

By way of example, the plug 227 has a lower portion with a first diameter and an upper portion with a second diameter that is larger than the first diameter. Therefore, an abutment surface is formed that abuts the upper end of the side wall of the vessel 104 and prevents further insertion of the plug when the maximal depth is reached. The illustrative embodiment further comprises an optional screw cap 228 that is provided with an inner thread 229 in order to engage an attachment means 106 of the vessel 104. As shown, the attachment means 106 may be formed by an outer thread formed on the outer surface of the vessel's wall. It should be noted that also other plugs (e.g., a generally cylindrical plug having a diameter that corresponds to the inner diameter of the upper end of the vessel 104) may be employed.
